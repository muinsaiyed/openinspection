/**
 * The CSV tokeniser for the intake path — adapters and the contacts importer
 * both read a file through this one function.
 *
 * It lives here rather than next to a writer because the adapter layer needs
 * it and may not depend on anything that touches the database. Sharing one
 * tokeniser across a single import matters: a looser second one splits a
 * quoted header containing a comma into a different number of columns, and the
 * preview and the commit then disagree about which column is which.
 *
 * ── Records, not lines ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * That warning used to apply to the tokeniser and not to the SPLIT, and the
 * split is where the same failure was actually happening. Both readers below
 * cut the file on `/\r?\n/` before tokenising anything, so a quoted field
 * containing a newline was torn in half: the continuation became a row of its
 * own, every column after it shifted, and nothing counted what was lost — the
 * file is still well-formed CSV, so there is no parse error to report.
 *
 * `splitCsvRecords` therefore does the quote tracking ONCE, for both readers,
 * and a record ends at a newline only when it is outside quotes. This is not a
 * hypothetical shape: the contacts export quotes a multi-line note, so our own
 * export was unreadable by our own importer.
