/**
 * What a destruction measured, and whether a given record can support today's
 * certification.
 *
 * Two questions that look like one. `status = completed` says the purge
 * finished what it set out to do. Certifiability says the record's measurement
 * universe is as wide as the one a certification would claim, and that every
 * store in it actually reported success. A record written before Durable
 * Objects were purgeable answers yes to the first and no to the second, and
 * that is correct rather than a defect: the old destruction did not fail, it
 * measured less.
 *
 * ── Why this is not a third status value ────────────────────────────────────
 * The obvious shape is `status = 'incomplete'`. `destruction-status.ts` has
 * exactly two values on purpose, with the reason written down: a purge cannot
 * report its own failure, because the failures worth recording are the ones
 * that stop it running at all, so ABSENCE of `completed` is the failure signal
 * and it survives a crash in a way a status write never could. A store that
 * refused to purge is a different fact — the run finished, and one measurement
 * came back unverified. Folding it into `status` would make `completed` mean
 * two things again, which is the exact conflation this module exists to end.
