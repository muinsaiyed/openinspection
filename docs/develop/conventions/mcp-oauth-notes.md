## 1. Resolved package versions

| Package | Resolved version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` | **0.8.1** | latest stable |
| `agents` | **0.17.1** | latest stable |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | **1.29.0** | pinned by `agents` too |
| `zod` (project) | **4.4.3** | our existing floor |

### Zod compatibility verdict

**No conflict.** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.29.0` declares `peerDependencies: { zod: "^3.25 || ^4.0" }`.
`agents@0.17.1` declares `peerDependencies: { zod: "^4.0.0" }`. Both work with our existing
`zod@^4.4.3`. `npm ls` confirms a single `zod@4.4.3` at the root, with only
`@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` nesting an unrelated `zod@3.25.76` under itself.
No `overrides` entry is needed for zod.

### React peer dep (agents) — the original conflict is gone

`agents@0.17.1` requires `react@^19.0.0` as a **peer dependency** (not listed in
`peerDependenciesMeta` as optional).

⚠️ **This section recorded a conflict that no longer exists.** It was written when the
project was on `react@^18.3.1` and said an upgrade was out of scope; the project has since
moved to React 19 (`react@^19.2.8`), so the peer dependency is satisfied on its own terms.

The committed project-root `.npmrc` still carries `legacy-peer-deps=true`, and its comment
still gives the React 18 reason. Nothing has been changed here on that basis — removing an
install-wide flag is a dependency-tree decision, not a documentation one — but a reader
should not take that comment as a current statement about React. Re-audit with
`npm ls --depth=0` before assuming the flag is still load-bearing.

We import only from `agents/mcp` (the Durable Object base class), which has no React runtime
dependency; `agents/react` (the frontend hooks the peer dep exists for) is not imported.

## 2. OAuthProvider configuration surface

Import path: `import { OAuthProvider, OAuthHelpers } from '@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider'`

### Constructor options (`OAuthProviderOptions<Env>`)

All fields are on `OAuthProviderOptions<Env>`:

| Option | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apiRoute` | `string \| string[]` | exclusive with `apiHandlers` | Literal prefix match(es); no pattern/glob support |
| `apiHandler` | `ExportedHandler \| WorkerEntrypoint class` | with `apiRoute` | Single-handler config |
| `apiHandlers` | `Record<string, handler>` | exclusive with `apiRoute`+`apiHandler` | Multi-handler: route → handler map |
| `defaultHandler` | `ExportedHandler \| WorkerEntrypoint class` | **required** | Handles non-API and unauthenticated requests |
| `authorizeEndpoint` | `string` | **required** | Path or URL of the consent UI (not implemented by the provider) |
| `tokenEndpoint` | `string` | **required** | Provider implements this endpoint |
| `clientRegistrationEndpoint` | `string` | optional | Provider implements RFC 7591 DCR here |
| `scopesSupported` | `string[]` | optional | Included as `scopes_supported` in RFC 8414 metadata |
| `accessTokenTTL` | `number` | optional | Seconds; default 3600 |
| `refreshTokenTTL` | `number` | optional | Seconds; default 2,592,000 (30 days); `0` disables |
| `clientRegistrationTTL` | `number` | optional | Seconds; default 7,776,000 (90 days) |
| `allowImplicitFlow` | `boolean` | optional | Default false |
| `allowPlainPKCE` | `boolean` | optional | Default true — ⚠️ **we set it to `false`, and the default is why.** See below. |
| `allowTokenExchangeGrant` | `boolean` | optional | Default false |
| `disallowPublicClientRegistration` | `boolean` | optional | Default false |
| `resourceMetadata` | `{ resource?, authorization_servers?, scopes_supported?, bearer_methods_supported?, resource_name? }` | optional | Customises `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` |
| `resourceMatchOriginOnly` | `boolean` | optional | Default false; when true, compares origins only during resource validation |
| `tokenExchangeCallback` | `fn` | optional | Mutate props on `authorization_code` / `refresh_token` exchange |
| `clientRegistrationCallback` | `fn` | optional | Intercept and approve/reject DCR requests |
| `resolveExternalToken` | `fn` | optional | Bridge external OAuth tokens (non-KV) |
| `onError` | `fn` | optional | Error hook; return `Response` to override |
| `clientIdMetadataDocumentEnabled` | `boolean` | optional | Default false; requires `global_fetch_strictly_public` compat flag |
| `enterpriseManagedAuthorization` | `EmaOptions` | optional | Experimental EMA/ID-JAG grant |

### ⚠️ `allowPlainPKCE` must stay `false`, and an omission is not neutral

`server/lib/mcp/oauth-provider.ts` passes `allowPlainPKCE: false`. Leaving it out
is not "taking the safe default" — the library's default is `true`, and three
things follow from it:

1. `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` advertises
   `code_challenge_methods_supported: ["plain", "S256"]`, so a client is told
   `plain` is acceptable on this deployment.
2. An authorize request that simply **omits** `code_challenge_method` is read as
   `plain` rather than refused. The weaker method is what you get by saying
   nothing, which is the opposite of how a security default should fail.
3. The token endpoint's `plain` branch compares the submitted verifier to the
   stored challenge **verbatim**. That is not a check. The challenge travelled to
   the browser in the same redirect URL as the authorization code, so anyone who
   intercepted the code already holds the value needed to redeem it.

PKCE exists to make a stolen authorization code unusable. `plain` returns it to
being usable, which makes advertising it **worse than offering no PKCE at all**:
a client that negotiates down believes it is protected and is not.

Setting the option to `false` does both halves — it narrows the advertisement to
`["S256"]` **and** makes the authorize parse refuse `plain` instead of serving
it. Narrowing the document alone would not be enough, because a client that
ignores the document, or that omits the parameter, would still be served.

Held by `tests/unit/mcp/oauth-pkce.spec.ts`, which deliberately asserts against
the INSTALLED LIBRARY rather than only against our options object: the defect was
an omission, so a test that checked only "we pass the flag" would stay green
through a rename of the option and leave the deployment advertising `plain`
again.

Unrelated, and worth not confusing with the above: the **outbound** Google
Calendar client in `server/lib/calendar/google.ts` also does PKCE, as a client
rather than as a server, and has always sent `S256`.

### `env.OAUTH_PROVIDER` — the `OAuthHelpers` interface

Available inside `defaultHandler.fetch(request, env, ctx)` and `apiHandler.fetch(request)` via `this.env`:

```ts
// Parse the incoming OAuth authorization request
const oauthReqInfo: AuthRequest = await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.parseAuthRequest(request);

// Look up a registered client
const client: ClientInfo | null = await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.lookupClient(clientId: string);

// Complete an authorization (returns redirect URL)
const { redirectTo } = await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.completeAuthorization({
  request: oauthReqInfo,     // AuthRequest from parseAuthRequest()
  userId: string,            // opaque user identifier
  metadata: unknown,         // audit metadata (not encrypted, visible in listUserGrants)
  scope: string[],           // granted scopes
  props: unknown,            // arbitrary payload — encrypted into token, passed to apiHandler as ctx.props
  revokeExistingGrants?: boolean,         // default true
  revokeExistingGrantsBatchSize?: number, // default 50
});

// Enumerate grants for a user (for audit/revocation UI)
const grants: ListResult<GrantSummary> = await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.listUserGrants(
  userId: string,
  options?: { limit?: number; cursor?: string }
);

// Revoke a single grant
await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.revokeGrant(grantId: string, userId: string);

// Inspect / decode an existing token
const summary: TokenSummary<T> | null = await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.unwrapToken<T>(token: string);

// Client management
await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.createClient(partial: Partial<ClientInfo>): Promise<ClientInfo>;
await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.listClients(opts?: ListOptions): Promise<ListResult<ClientInfo>>;
await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.updateClient(clientId, updates): Promise<ClientInfo | null>;
await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.deleteClient(clientId): Promise<void>;

// Garbage collection (call from a Cron Trigger)
await env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.purgeExpiredData(opts?: PurgeOptions): Promise<PurgeResult>;
```

The `props` passed to `completeAuthorization()` are **end-to-end encrypted** at rest in KV using
the access token as key material. On every authenticated API request the provider decrypts them
and injects them into the execution context as `ctx.props`. Inside a `WorkerEntrypoint`
apiHandler, `this.ctx.props` holds the decrypted props object.

## 3. McpAgent — import path, serve signature, Props generic, this.props

### Import path

```ts
import { McpAgent, getMcpAuthContext } from 'agents/mcp';
```

The `agents/mcp` export (defined in `agents` package.json `exports[./mcp]`) maps to
`dist/mcp/index.js`. `McpAgent` is the only abstract base class needed for a DO-hosted MCP server.

### Class declaration

```ts
abstract class McpAgent<
  Env extends Cloudflare.Env = Cloudflare.Env,
  State = unknown,
  Props extends Record<string, unknown> = Record<string, unknown>
> extends Agent<Env, State, Props>
```

Generic position: **Env, State, Props** (in that order). For a tenant-aware agent:

```ts
type MyProps = { tenantSlug: string; userId: string; scopes: string[] };
class InspectorMcp extends McpAgent<Env, never, MyProps> { ... }
```

### `serve()` signature

```ts
static serve(
  path: string,
  {
    binding = 'MCP_OBJECT',   // wrangler.jsonc DO binding name; change if needed
    corsOptions?: CORSOptions,
    transport?: 'streamable-http' | 'sse' | 'auto',  // default 'streamable-http'
    jurisdiction?: DurableObjectJurisdiction
  }?: ServeOptions
): { fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> }
```

`McpAgent.serve()` returns a fetch handler object that routes incoming HTTP/WebSocket requests
to the Durable Object. The DO instance name is `streamable-http:{sessionId}` (where `sessionId`
comes from the `mcp-session-id` request header, or a new unique ID for a fresh session).

### How `this.props` is populated

1. **Authorization flow**: The consent handler calls `env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.completeAuthorization({ ..., props: { tenantSlug, userId, ... } })`. The provider encrypts `props` into the access token.
2. **Authenticated API request**: `OAuthProvider` decrypts the token and sets `ctx.props` on the execution context before forwarding the request to the `apiHandler`.
3. **Inside `McpAgent.serve()`**: The handler calls `getAgentByName(namespace, doName, { props: ctx.props })`. The framework calls `onStart(props?: Props)` on the DO, which sets `this.props`.
4. **Inside the DO**: `this.props` (typed as `Props | undefined`) holds the decrypted OAuth grant props. Access them in `init()`, tool handlers, etc.

The `updateProps(props?: Props)` method re-runs `onStart` and persists new props to DO storage.

For non-DO MCP servers (using `createMcpHandler`), use `getMcpAuthContext()` which returns
`McpAuthContext | undefined` — reads `{ props: Record<string, unknown> }` from AsyncLocalStorage.

## 4. SaaS apiRoute strategy — spec §11.1 and §11.3

### §11.1 — Does the provider emit PATH-SCOPED RFC 9728 PRM?

**Yes, with dynamic derivation.** The provider serves RFC 9728 Protected Resource Metadata not only
at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (host-root) but also at any path-suffixed variant per
RFC 9728 §3.1:

```
/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource         → resource: https://host.com
/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp     → resource: https://host.com/mcp
/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp/acme → resource: https://host.com/mcp/acme
```

Source: `deriveResourceIdentifier(requestUrl)` in `oauth-provider.js` (line ~978):
```js
// pathname.slice(37) strips the 37-char "/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource" prefix
const suffix = requestUrl.pathname.slice(37);
if (!suffix || suffix === '/') return requestUrl.origin;
return `${requestUrl.origin}${suffix}`;
```

This derivation is used only when `resourceMetadata.resource` is **not** statically configured.
If `resourceMetadata.resource` is set, it overrides dynamic derivation for all PRM requests.

The `authorization_servers`, `scopes_supported`, and `bearer_methods_supported` fields in the
PRM response are the same for all path variants — only the `resource` identifier differs.

### §11.3 — SaaS apiRoute strategy

**Conclusion: both modes use `apiRoute: '/mcp'`. Standalone serves the single fixed
endpoint `/mcp`; SaaS serves per-workspace endpoint URLs `/mcp/{slug}` under the same
prefix. The tenant slug is present in BOTH the URL path (for per-workspace URLs +
per-workspace RFC 8707 resource binding) AND the OAuth grant `props` (the authoritative
value the DO trusts for tenant scoping).**

> **Superseded — the SaaS mount used to be `apiRoute: '/company/'`.** `apiRoute` is a
> literal prefix, so that value made the OAuth provider treat EVERY `/company/*` request
> as an authenticated API request. It held a whole top-level namespace hostage to a "do
> not add a `/company/*` route" caveat written in this file — a rule enforced by nothing,
> in a document a route author has no reason to open. Narrowing the mount to `/mcp`
> releases `/company/*` and deletes the caveat instead of restating it. An even earlier
> draft used the abbreviated `/t/` prefix — also superseded.

The design deliberately keeps **tenant-in-URL + RFC 8707 resource indicator**; only the
prefix changed. The path-based approach is REQUIRED — not merely cosmetic — because two
things a query-string approach cannot provide are mandatory here:

1. **Per-workspace distinct URLs** — each workspace gets its own canonical MCP endpoint
   (`https://host.com/mcp/acme`), so MCP clients register and store one URL per workspace.
2. **Per-workspace RFC 8707 resource binding** — path-scoped RFC 9728 PRM derives a *distinct*
   resource identifier per workspace (`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp/acme` →
   `resource: 'https://host.com/mcp/acme'`). Access tokens are then bound (via the RFC 8707
   `resource` indicator) to that specific workspace's resource, so a token minted for `acme`
   cannot be replayed against `globex`'s endpoint.

How `apiRoute` matching works (mechanical facts that shape the implementation):

- `apiRoute` is a **literal string prefix match** — no patterns, no wildcards, no `:slug`
  expansion. A slug-parameterized value would only match URLs literally containing the
  characters of the parameter (the colon is literal), so it CANNOT be used. The prefix
  `'/mcp'` covers `/mcp` and `/mcp/{slug}` alike, and the handler matches the precise
  shape.
- The tenant slug is parsed from the URL path segment to select the workspace endpoint, but the
  DO trusts `this.props.tenantSlug` (encrypted in the OAuth grant) as the authoritative tenant
  for all data access. The URL slug and the props slug MUST agree — the handler rejects any
  request where the path slug ≠ the granted `props.tenantSlug` (prevents a token for one
  workspace being used against another workspace's URL).
- The DO instance name is determined by session ID (`streamable-http:{sessionId}`), not by slug.

**Standalone:** endpoint `/mcp`
- Single fixed endpoint; no slug segment, so the slug guard is inert by construction
- PRM auto-served at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` → `resource: 'https://host.com/mcp'`
- `this.props.tenantSlug` carries the tenant from the OAuth grant (SINGLE_TENANT_ID is the only tenant)

**SaaS:** endpoint `/mcp/{slug}`
- Same registered prefix `'/mcp'`; the slug is the segment after it
- Per-workspace PRM is auto-derived: `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp/acme` →
  `resource: 'https://host.com/mcp/acme'` (distinct resource id per workspace = RFC 8707 binding)
- The MCP agent (DO) reads `this.props.tenantSlug` for tenant scoping; path slug is validated against it
- `McpAgent.serve('/mcp')` matches its mount literally via URLPattern, so the handler reduces
  `/mcp/{slug}` back to `/mcp` before delegating

> **Why one handler covers both modes.** The slug guard fires on the PATH shape, not on the
> mode: `/mcp` has no slug segment and is delegated untouched, `/mcp/{slug}` is checked and
> reduced. Deriving the guard from the request rather than from a second mode flag is what
> stops the two from drifting apart (OI #308).

**Rejected alternative — `apiRoute: '/mcp'` + `?workspace={slug}` query param.** Simpler to
route, but it FAILS the spec's requirements: all workspaces would share the single endpoint URL
`https://host.com/mcp` and therefore a single PRM resource identifier (`https://host.com/mcp`).
That collapses the per-workspace RFC 8707 resource binding — one token would be valid for the
shared resource regardless of workspace, losing the per-workspace token isolation §4.2 requires.

## 5. Required wrangler.jsonc additions

For any MCP integration to work, the following must be present in wrangler.jsonc:

What actually shipped, in the committed `wrangler.jsonc` — the binding name and class are
**not** `McpAgent`'s defaults, and the migration tag is whichever one is next in that file's
own chain (`v3` here, because two DO classes preceded it):

```jsonc
{
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [
      { "name": "INSPECTOR_MCP", "class_name": "InspectorMcp" }
    ]
  },
  "kv_namespaces": [
    { "binding": "OAUTH_KV", "id": "<your-kv-id>" }
  ],
  "migrations": [
    { "tag": "v3", "new_sqlite_classes": ["InspectorMcp"] }
  ]
}
```

The `OAUTH_KV` binding name is hardcoded in `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` — it cannot be
changed without forking the library.

`McpAgent.serve()` defaults its binding to `MCP_OBJECT`; this deployment overrides it by
passing `{ binding: 'INSPECTOR_MCP' }`.
