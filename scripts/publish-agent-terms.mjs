/**
 * Publish the deployment's agent terms.
 *
 * `POST /api/agent-signup` refuses while nothing is published: a deployment that
 * has not published a document written for agents cannot take an agent's
 * agreement to one. This script is the only way out of that state, and it is
 * deliberately hard to run by accident.
 *
 * ── What it refuses, and why each refusal exists ────────────────────────────
 *  - A body still containing a `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`. `{{GOVERNING_LAW}}` must not
 *    survive to publication, and governing law is not the only one: a liability
 *    cap of `{{LIABILITY_FLOOR}}` is worse than no cap because it reads as a
 *    term. This check is what makes that rule mechanical instead of remembered.
 *  - A body whose status line still says draft. The document carries its own
 *    review state, and publishing a file that says it is not published is a
 *    contradiction no reviewer would sign off.
 *  - A missing or malformed `--version`. The version is the date a reader is shown
 *    and it goes on every acceptance; deriving it from today's clock would stamp
 *    the deploy date onto a document that was approved on another day.
 *
 * ── What it strips ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * HTML comments. The file carries the review status and the open decision
 * points inline so they travel with the text under review — and none of that is
 * part of the agreement. Publishing them would put our open questions in front of
 * the signer. The stripped body is what gets hashed, so the hash is of exactly
 * what a signer sees.
 *
 * Idempotent on the CONTENT HASH, not the version: the same words published twice
 * return the existing version. A changed body under an already-published version
 * string is refused by the service — a version people accepted cannot come to mean
 * different words.

// The body, with a DEPLOYMENT-LOCAL override.
//
// `agent-terms.md` is tracked, and it is a template: §1 names the counterparty as
// "{{OPERATOR_NAME}} … which operates this deployment". Who that is differs for
// every deployment, which is why the operator fields are placeholders and why the
// gate below refuses to publish while any survive. Filling them in the tracked
// file would make every deployment built from this repository publish terms
// naming whoever happened to edit it — wrong for everyone else, and a change each
// operator would have to carry as a permanent local diff.
//
// So an operator writes their own body to `agent-terms.local.md`, which is
// gitignored beside `wrangler.*.jsonc` and `.dev.vars*` for the same reason: it is
// deployment identity, not source. When present it wins; otherwise the template is
// read and the gate stops the publish, which is the correct outcome for a
// deployment that has not written its own terms yet.
//
// Start from the template (`cp agent-terms.md agent-terms.local.md`), fill the
// operator fields, and clear the draft status line. The header line printed below
// names whichever file was actually read, so a publish can never leave you
// guessing which text was hashed.

// Strip HTML comments FIRST, so the checks below run against what a signer sees.
// The draft banner and the decision points live in comments precisely so they are
// reviewable without being publishable, and a placeholder mentioned inside a
// comment must not block a body that no longer contains one.
//
// ── Why this loops, and then REFUSES ────────────────────────────────────────
// A single pass is not a sanitizer, and CodeQL flagged this exact line for it.
// Removing one comment SPLICES its neighbours together, and two fragments that
// were harmless apart can form a new opener: `<!` + `<!-- -->` + `-- >` leaves
// `<!-- >` after one pass.
//
// The loop is not what fixes that — it was measured, and it does not: `<!-- >`
// has no closer, so a second pass removes nothing and the loop terminates with
// the marker still there. The loop only closes the cases where a full removal
// IS reachable. What actually closes the reported hole is the REFUSAL below.
//
// `--!>` is in the pattern because HTML accepts it as a comment terminator just
// as it accepts `-->`, and CodeQL flagged the first version of this fix for
// missing it. A stripper that knows only one of the two closers leaves the whole
// remainder of the document inside a comment it thinks is still open — the exact
// shape of "the gate read a body that is not the published one".
//
// An unbalanced marker means the file's comment structure is not what this gate
// assumes, and a gate that mis-parsed its input must not go on to report the
// body clean. Its whole job is to notice a placeholder or a draft banner that
// survived into published text, and both hide inside exactly this ambiguity.
