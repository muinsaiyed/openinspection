/**
 * Issue #111 — pure helpers for the `/inspections/:id` hub page.
 *
 * `deriveBlockStates(hub)` collapses the aggregate hub payload into the three
 * status pills the page renders (agreement / invoice / report). It is a pure
 * function with no React or network dependency so every status branch is unit
 * testable in isolation (see tests/unit/inspections/inspector-portal.spec.ts).
 *
 * `formatCents` is the cents → "$X.XX" formatter used by the Services block.
 * It delegates to the shared locale-aware formatter; locale/currency default to
 * en-US/USD (behavior-preserving) and callers thread the viewer values when known.
