/**
 * Where one tenant's QuickBooks credentials come from, in a context with no
 * middleware.
 *
 * `integrationSecretsMiddleware` merges a tenant's encrypted secrets into
 * `c.env`, and it returns early for any path that does not start `/api/`. Cron
 * has no Hono chain at all, so a sweep that reads `env.QBO_CLIENT_ID` directly
 * sees the PLATFORM credential or nothing — and under `qboAppManaged: false` a
 * self-hosted operator has nowhere to put a credential except the tenant row.
 * That is how a connection could work in the browser, read "Active" in
 * Settings, and never once sync.
 *
 * The precedence rule is NOT restated here. `applyIntegrationSecrets` owns it
 * (env wins; the tenant row is the self-host fallback; `TENANT_OWNED_KEYS`
 * inverts it for Stripe so a stray platform key cannot route an inspector's
 * homebuyer payments into the platform account). A second copy of a precedence
 * rule is exactly how the OAuth callback's guard came to disagree with it.
