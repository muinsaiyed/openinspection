/**
 * Drawing ONE PART of a value, because the form printed the separators itself.
 *
 * ── The failure this exists to stop ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Florida's OIR-B1-1802 prints a date as three separate blanks with its OWN
 * slashes printed in the gaps between them. Measured on page 0: MM occupies
 * 472.20–492.30, the form's slash 492.36–495.13, DD 495.12–515.10, its second
 * slash 515.16–517.93, YYYY 517.80–557.81.
 *
 * One overlay drawing `03/15/2026` at 9pt Helvetica from x=473.7 is 45.0pt wide
 * and ends at 518.736. So the year sits across the DD blank and the second gap,
 * our slashes are drawn beside the form's, and 39.08 of the year blank's 40.02
 * points stay empty. Nothing raises. The page renders, prints and files, and
 * only the content is wrong -- on a document that goes to an insurer and a
 * state regulator.
 *
 * ── Why a closed set of named parts, and not a slicer ───────────────────────
 * A general `slice: { offset, length }` does this job and also does it wrong
 * silently: (0,2) of `2026-03-15` is `20`, which is a perfectly month-shaped
 * string, lands in the month blank, and is contradicted by nothing. An offset is
 * also welded to one input format, so the day the source format moves it cuts a
 * different substring rather than failing. A format string (`'MM'`) is the same
 * problem with a friendlier face: it is an open string, so `'mm'` and `'MMM'`
 * compile, and the entire observable result of that typo is a BLANK BOX.
 *
 * A closed union fails in the compiler, where the mistake is cheap.
 *
 * ── Why only `YYYY-MM-DD` ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Measured 2026-08-29, every source that can reach a part yields it:
 * `inspections.date` is TEXT and `produce.service.ts` runs `utcMidnightOf` over
 * it before anything else, so a non-ISO inspection date already refuses the
 * whole production; a `date` item and a `date` attribute are both entered
 * through `<input type="date">`.
 *
 * So a slashed string arriving here is EVIDENCE -- that the binding points at a
 * free-text item. Parsing it would make one document right and hide the binding;
 * refusing sends the person to the thing that makes every future inspection
 * right. Nothing here can decide whether a hand-typed `04/03/2026` is April 3rd
 * or the 4th of March either: the form prints `(MM/DD/YYYY)` over its own boxes,
 * and says nothing about the text box in our editor.
 *
 * ⚠️ This strictness is affordable only now. `PUBLISHED_FORM_VERSIONS` and
 * `FIELD_MAPS` are both `[]`, so no workflow breaks. Loosening later is
 * possible; tightening later is not.
 *
 * `import type` from `field-map.ts` is erased at build time, so the only real
 * module edge is field-map -> here. There is no cycle.

 * page 1 of a produced REI 7-6. A Texas inspector writes 08/20/2026, and the

 * governs what this software shows its own users; the box on a promulgated form
 * is the authority's, and a workspace that prefers ISO must not be able to print
 * ISO on somebody else's statutory document.
 *
 * Every form this software publishes today is a US authority's, and every one of
 * them either prints `(MM/DD/YYYY)` beside the blank (OIR-B1-1802) or assumes it
 * (TREC, Citizens). The day a form arrives that prints a day any other way, this
 * stops being a property of "a statutory form" and becomes one of THAT form, and

/**
 * A part's blank holds the digits that part draws — checked without any data.
 *
 * ── Why this is exact rather than an estimate ───────────────────────────────
 * Every Helvetica digit advances 556/1000 of the em, so `'0'.repeat(n)` is not a
 * worst case, it is THE case. A part is always two digits or four. The map
 * therefore already contains everything needed to know how wide the text will
 * be, which no other overlay can say.
 *
 * ── Why it lives on the async half ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * It needs a FONT, and embedding one is the same class of cost as loading the
 * document: it cannot happen in the synchronous half. The font is embedded in a
 * scratch document rather than in the agency's, exactly as `render.ts` does for
 * its ruler — needing to measure is not grounds for putting an object of ours
 * into a document we otherwise leave alone.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS DOES NOT REACH. `fieldMapFor()` calls only the synchronous
 * `validateFieldMap`, so this does not run per lookup in production; the
 * backstop there is the `fitOverlay` refusal at render time. This one runs where
 * a map is authored and in CI, which is where a mis-measured blank is cheap.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND WHAT IT CANNOT SEE AT ALL. It proves the blank you measured holds these
 * digits. It cannot prove you measured the right blank — that failure renders,
 * prints and files with only the content wrong, and only a person reading the
 * form catches it.
