## Operating a deployment

Running the engine on your own Cloudflare account. Start at the quickstart if you
have never deployed it; it is the same path with every deferrable decision
deferred.

| Doc | Topic |
|---|---|
| [`quickstart.md`](quickstart.md) | Empty Cloudflare account to a workspace you can log into, in about 20 minutes |
| [`operate/deploy.md`](operate/deploy.md) | First-time production deploy — one-click, CLI, and what gets provisioned |
| [`operate/upgrade.md`](operate/upgrade.md) | Move an existing deployment to a newer release (forward-only) — including the one-time reconcile a rebuilt baseline needs |
| [`operate/sms-compliance.md`](operate/sms-compliance.md) | Privacy/Terms pages, carrier registration, TCPA/CTIA wording |
| [`operate/rotate-jwt-keyring.md`](operate/rotate-jwt-keyring.md) | Rotating the ES256 JWT keyring without invalidating live sessions |

## Using the product

**Not here.** The user guide lives at <https://inspectorhub.io/docs> — the
inspection workflow end to end: create, inspect, publish, deliver, get paid.

It is not in this repository because it is not about this repository. A page
explaining how to record a finding or send a report describes the product, and
the product is the same product whether you run it yourself or somebody runs it
for you — so one copy serves both, illustrated with screenshots taken from the
software in this repository (`tests/docs-shots/`). Splitting it would give
self-hosters the worse of two guides.

Where a screen genuinely differs by deployment mode, the hosted page says so
inline. Capability by capability, the difference is
[`reference/deployment-modes.md`](reference/deployment-modes.md).

## Integrations

One page per external service: what it does, which credentials, which direction
data flows, and what breaks when it is not configured. Full index and the
conventions common to all of them: [`integrations/README.md`](integrations/README.md).

| [`integrations/sms.md`](integrations/sms.md) | Twilio and Telnyx, and the single gate every outbound message passes |
| [`integrations/google-calendar.md`](integrations/google-calendar.md) | Per-inspector two-way sync over OAuth |
| [`integrations/apple-calendar.md`](integrations/apple-calendar.md) | The same over CalDAV — all-or-nothing, no read-only |

*what* and you need *why*.

## Editing these docs

Two of the pages here are checked by gates rather than by eyes:

- **Every relative link must resolve.** `npm run lint:doclinks` walks every
  tracked markdown file and fails on a link to a file that does not exist. It
  runs inside `npm run lint`, so CI enforces it. (It was written because three
  links in `CONTRIBUTING.md` had been dead for months — one pointed at a file
  that has never existed in this repository.)
- **`reference/deployment-modes.md` is generated.** Edit the profile constants
  in `server/lib/deployment-profile.ts` and the descriptions in
  `scripts/gen-deployment-modes-doc.ts`, then run `npm run docs:modes`.
  `tests/unit/platform/deployment-modes-doc.spec.ts` fails if the checked-in
  table disagrees with the constants, or if a capability has no description.

Everything else is ordinary prose — but prefer stating the invariant over
recounting the history, same as in code comments.

**No number prefixes on filenames** (`01_setup.md`, `02_deploy.md`, …), in this
directory or its subdirectories. A number prefix encodes reading order into
the filename itself, so inserting a doc in the middle means renaming every
file after it — and every link, cross-reference, and bookmark to those files
breaks at the same time. The table above already carries reading order *and*
the reason for it, which a bare number never does. Name files after what they
cover.
