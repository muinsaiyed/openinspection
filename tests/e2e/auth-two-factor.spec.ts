/**
 * Two-factor sign-in, end to end against the seeded standalone worker.
 *
 * STANDALONE IS THE POINT, not a convenience. In SaaS the engine has no local
 * login — `GET /login` 302s to the portal and `POST /api/auth/login` answers
 * 410 LOGIN_MOVED_TO_PORTAL — so this challenge is unreachable there. Standalone
 * is the deployment where the engine's own login page is the only door, and
 * therefore the one where getting this wrong locks an operator out of their own
 * self-hosted install with no portal to go round by.
 *
 * That is what this spec exists to prevent. `server/api/auth.ts` has answered a
 * 2FA account's correct password with a five-minute challenge token since 2FA
 * was written, and `app/routes/login.tsx` used to answer that challenge with
 * "2FA is not yet supported in the new frontend" — the server knew the password
 * was right, issued a challenge, and the only screen that could have answered
 * it refused.
 *
 * The TOTP codes here are computed from the secret the server just issued,
 * which is exactly what an authenticator app does with the same secret. The
 * account is enrolled and then DISABLED again, so the suite leaves the seeded
 * admin as it found it — a spec that leaves 2FA on would lock every later spec
 * out of the same account.

/**
 * The two ways the local dev worker drops a request underneath us. Matched on
 * the BODY, because the status code alone does not distinguish either of them
 * from a real server fault.
 *
 * 1. `wrangler dev` reloads after the build settles and answers anything in
 *    flight with 503 "Your worker restarted mid-request… Only GET or HEAD
 *    requests are retried automatically".
 * 2. The isolate is recycled and the next request in lands on it as it goes
 *    away: miniflare answers 500 with "Network connection lost".
 *
 * Shape 2 was diagnosed 2026-09-06 and is why this list is a list. Measured
 * outside Playwright entirely, with plain fetch against a hand-started dev
 * server: after `POST /2fa/setup` returns 200, the NEXT request fails this way
 * and the two after it succeed — and the server keeps serving `/status`
 * throughout, so nothing crashed. It is not the verify handler, which is a
 * lookup, a TOTP check and one UPDATE; it is the request that follows setup,
 * whichever one that happens to be. Setup is the heaviest call in the suite
 * (eight recovery-code hashes plus QR generation), and the worker log has no
 * entry for the dropped request at all.
 *
 * Retrying is honest here and hiding it would not be: on the first shape the
 * suite already retried, and the second is the same event wearing a different
 * status. Both retry ONCE and only on their own message, so a genuine 500 or
 * 503 still reaches the assertion untouched.

 * Paths this suite may safely send twice.
 *
 * The 503 shape needs no such list: wrangler's own message says non-GET
 * requests are NOT retried automatically, which is a statement that the handler
 * did not run. The 500 shape carries no equivalent guarantee — miniflare can
 * report a dropped connection after the worker began executing — so retrying it
 * blindly is a real hazard on exactly one call here. `POST /2fa/setup` mints a
 * new secret and eight fresh recovery codes on every invocation, so a silent
 * second execution would rotate them out from under the response the test
 * already captured, and the later assertions would fail as though the product
 * had lost the codes.
 *
 * Everything else the suite POSTs is replay-safe: verify sets totpEnabled=true,
 * login/2fa exchanges a challenge that stays valid until spent, and disable
 * clears state that is already clear.
