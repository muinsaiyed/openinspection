 * records their outcome. The card also offered a "Send report" button directly
 * beneath that sentence, which is the contradiction that gives the lie away.
 *
 * Publication time is a fact the hub does have — the report_versions rows carry
 * `publishedAt` — so the card can state that instead of inventing a delivery.
