/**
 * The multi-user-seed E2E run: `npm run test:e2e:seeded`.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SECOND CONFIG AND NOT TWO MORE PROJECTS IN THE FIRST ONE.
 *
 * `tests/seed-fixtures.ts` writes its users into TENANT_A, and TENANT_A *is*
 * the standalone workspace (`SINGLE_TENANT_ID`) — standalone login resolves no
 * other tenant, so the fixtures cannot live anywhere else. But the default
 * run's `api` project opens with API-01 asserting that
 * `POST /api/auth/setup` returns a FRESH 200, and setup 409s
 * (`already_initialized`) the moment any user has a tenant. The seed and that
 * assertion are mutually exclusive by construction, in one shared D1.
 *
 * So they are two runs, not two projects: the default suite stays unseeded and
 * `api` still proves a cold install works, and this config seeds and runs the
 * subsystem specs that need the seeded workspace. Both drive the SAME worker
 * (`reuseExistingServer`), so running them back to back costs one boot.
 *
 * The alternative — leaving these specs in the default config and skipping them
 * unless SEED_E2E is set — was rejected: it puts nine tests back in the
 * permanently-skipped column that this split exists to empty.
