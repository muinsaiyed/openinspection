/**
 * <ReportUnavailable> — what the reader sees instead of a report.
 *
 * Three outcomes, one place, because choosing between them is the whole logic:
 *
 *  1. Not published yet — the report exists but the inspector has not released
 *     it. Nothing is wrong; say so plainly.
 *
 *  2. IA-36 ⑨ — "we took this link offline" (410) and "this link names
 *     nothing" (404) render the SAME page on purpose.
 *
 *     The reader cannot act on the difference and we cannot always tell them
 *     the truth anyway: rotating a link overwrites its row in place, so a
 *     recipient holding the superseded URL is indistinguishable from someone
 *     who mistyped one — both arrive as 404. Splitting the copy would mean
 *     confidently telling a legitimate client "no such report" when we in fact
 *     replaced their link ten minutes ago.
 *
 *     So the page states both possibilities and names the recovery path. The
 *     wire keeps 410 and 404 distinct — support and the audit trail need to
 *     know which happened even when the reader doesn't.
 *
 *  3. Anything else — a generic load failure.
 *
 * The caller renders this INSTEAD of the report, never alongside it.
