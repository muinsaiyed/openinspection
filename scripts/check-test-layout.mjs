/**
 * Test-layout gate (R1/R4/R6/R8 of the 2026-07 tests reorg).
 *  - no .spec.ts directly under tests/ or tests/web/ (directory = suite)
 *  - no .spec.ts directly under tests/unit/ (must live in a domain dir)
 *  - E2E is the single tests/e2e/ — tests/web/unit, tests/web/e2e, tests/integration must not exist
 *  - every playwright.config.ts project testMatch resolves to a file in tests/e2e
 *
 * That last rule is ONE-DIRECTIONAL: it proves a project points at a file, not
 * that a file is pointed at by a project. The reverse — a spec collected by no
 * config, which never runs and therefore never fails — is `lint:e2e-coverage`,
 * a separate gate because it has to ask Playwright rather than read a file, and
 * that costs seconds where everything here costs milliseconds.
