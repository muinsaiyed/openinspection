/**
 * Jurisdictional messaging rules, and the two ways this repository has already
 * got them wrong.
 *
 * One premise we had asserted was wrong: the 8am-9pm restriction
 * lives in the telephone-solicitation rules (47 CFR 64.1200(c)(1), imposed on a
 * "telephone solicitation" as (f)(15) defines it), and a transactional robotext
 * does not inherit it. A second correction: CASL 6(6) excuses
 * "Paragraph (1)(a)" — the consent limb — and only for a message that SOLELY
 * does one of the listed things, so identification and unsubscribe survive the
 * exception untouched. `transactional = exempt` is not a rule this file may
 * express.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion is the LAST one in the first block: an unstudied
 * jurisdiction must THROW. A fallback is how a rule proven in one place becomes
 * a global rule, and both of the corrections above began as exactly that — a
 * summary of a neighbouring rule applied where nobody had read the text.
 * `US/TX` therefore throws even though `US/CA` is right there, and that case is
 * here on purpose: "no rule for ZZ" is easy to pass with a country check, and it
 * is the plausible-looking near-miss that a fallback would answer.
