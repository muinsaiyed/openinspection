/**
 * The prompts every AI feature sends, addressable by a stable version token.
 *
 * They used to be inline template literals inside `AIService`, which made them
 * unnameable: a prompt could be reworded in a routine edit and nothing —
 * no test, no log line, no stored row — could tell an old output from a new
 * one afterwards. A prompt is the largest single input to what the model
 * returns, so it needs the same treatment as any other versioned input.
 *
 * Each entry carries a `version` that is a NAME, not a hash and not a
 * timestamp: it is written down once and changed only when the wording
 * changes. Bump the suffix (`.v1` → `.v2`) in the same commit that edits the
 * text, never separately. These tokens are now PERSISTED: every call writes one
 * into `ai_call_provenance.prompt_version` at the AI chokepoint, so a stored
 * output can be traced back to the wording that produced it. Bumping a suffix
 * without editing the text, or editing the text without bumping, corrupts that
 * record for every row written afterwards.
 *
 * Rewording a prompt changes model output, and no test in this repository would
 * notice.
