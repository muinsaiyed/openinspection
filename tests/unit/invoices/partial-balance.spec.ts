/**
 * Partial-payment capture (OI #273, bug half).
 *
 * QuickBooks returns `{ Balance, TotalAmt }` and the invoice sync already
 * decides the 'partial' branch from them — but every adapter dropped the
 * number, so a partially-paid invoice could say THAT something was paid and
 * never HOW MUCH. These specs pin the three things that are easy to get wrong
 * once the amount is actually stored:
 *
 *  1. We persist the amount PAID, never QuickBooks' remaining Balance. Our
 *     `invoices.amountCents` is the authoritative total (money authority
 *     chain), so remaining must be derived against it; storing QBO's Balance
 *     would state a remainder computed against QuickBooks' total, which drifts
 *     the first time either side edits the invoice.
 *  2. QBO speaks dollars. The dollar-to-cent conversion rounds, because a bare
 *     float multiply yields off-by-one-cent balances nobody can explain.
 *  3. Paid-in-full and refunded both clear it, so the amount can never
 *     contradict the status derived from `paidAt` / `partialPaidAt`.
