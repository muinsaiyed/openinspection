 * Deployment profile capability surface.
 *
 * Centralises every mode-specific decision the worker makes into 2
 * immutable `DeploymentProfile` constants. Read a capability; never
 * branch on `env.APP_MODE` yourself.
 *
 * Three sanctioned readers, by what you are holding:
 *
 *   Hono handler / middleware ............ c.var.profile.<capability>
 *   only an env (RR loader or action,
 *   cron, Workflow, queue consumer) ...... getDeploymentProfile(env).<capability>
 *   client component ..................... isSaas / deployment.mode from
 *                                          the session context
 *
 * The middle row is why `getDeploymentProfile` takes `ProfileEnv` rather
 * than `AppEnv`: before OI #308 it demanded an env most callers did not
 * have, and nine sites wrote their own branch instead. Enforced by
 * tests/unit/sync/portal-isolation.spec.ts.
 *
 * Silo deconvergence (2026-05-29): silo + shared SaaS collapsed into
 * a single SAAS_PROFILE. The remaining "silo vs shared" distinction
 * is a per-tenant property (tenants.deploymentMode) that signals
 * which D1 backend to query — not a deployment-wide topology.
 *
 * See `docs/reference/deployment-modes.md`.
