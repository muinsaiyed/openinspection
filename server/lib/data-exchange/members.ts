/**
 * The tenant-member view of the `users` table as a file.
 *
 * Two things about this manifest are worth stating once.
 *
 * FIRST: `users` carries credentials, and the members export never sees them —
 * BY CONSTRUCTION, not by a filter. `password_hash`, `totp_secret` and
 * `totp_recovery_codes` are simply not among the fields below, and the
 * projection reads the fields. That is a stronger guarantee than the one
 * `server/lib/compliance/account-export-manifest.ts` had to build: that export
 * star-selects, so it needs EVERY column classified to be safe. This one names
 * what it takes. The three credential columns still appear in `notExported`
 * below, and their reasons cross-reference that file rather than re-arguing it.
 *
 * SECOND: a members round trip is a RE-INVITATION, not a restoration. `id` is
 * `exportOnly`, so an import creates rows and the existing seat and conflict
 * machinery decides what happens to somebody who is already a member.
 *
 * ⚠️ A reason here is prose, and prose is not evidence. Before relying on one,
 * go read what writes the column.
