 * Property/transaction grouping for the agent portal.

 * address falls back to its own id, so addressless rows stay separate instead of
 * all merging into one "No address" bucket.
 *
 * Shared by the dashboard and the repair-items page — the two must agree, or the
 * agent sees the same deal split differently on two pages.
