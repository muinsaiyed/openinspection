/**
 * One recipient's answer to "send me this or don't", per notification class
 * per channel.
 *
 * ONE SUBJECT COLUMN, NOT TWO. The obvious shape is a nullable `user_id` and a
 * nullable `contact_id` with a rule that exactly one is set. SQLite treats
 * NULLs as DISTINCT in a unique index, so `(t1, NULL, 'c1', 'email')` does not
 * conflict with itself — the constraint meant to guarantee one row per
 * (who, what, how) would silently permit duplicates, and a duplicate here means
 * two contradictory answers with no rule for which wins. `subjectKind` +
 * `subjectId` are both NOT NULL, so the index actually holds and the
 * two-columns-one-truth state cannot be written.
 *
 * `subjectKind` distinguishes an ACCOUNT holder (staff, agent — rows in
 * `users`) from a CONTACT (a client with no login — rows in `contacts`). They
 * are different id spaces that can collide, so the kind is part of the key, not
 * a hint.
 *
 * ABSENCE IS NOT "OFF". No row means the class's default applies, which is
 * "send". Only an explicit `enabled = false` suppresses, and only for a class
 * `isSuppressible()` allows — see `server/lib/notifications/classes.ts`, which
 * fails closed on ids it has never heard of. A preference can therefore never
 * silence a notification the recipient is told is always sent.
 *
 * Erasure: rows here are deleted with their subject. A contact id can be
 * reused after an erasure, and inheriting the erased person's mute settings
 * would be both wrong and invisible.
