/**
 * How ONE binding becomes ONE string.
 *
 * -- WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE ----------------------------------------------
 * `values.ts` answers a different question: how a whole declaration becomes the
 * values object, with groups expanded and overflow routed. This answers the
 * smaller one underneath it, and the two are read at different moments -- a
 * person adding a source kind comes here and nowhere else.
 *
 * The disciplines `values.ts` documents are kept, and two of them live HERE:
 * every refusal names the id somebody has to search for, and a value that
 * resolves to "the inspector answered nothing" is an empty string rather than a
 * missing key. Absent and empty are not the same fact, and only this side can
 * tell them apart.

 * requirements, electrical hazards, wiring types, pipe types, roof damage
 * signs, the 1802's roof coverings) — and `render.ts` has always been able to
 * tick every box a list names. This is the end of the pipe that was narrower:
 * everything used to arrive through `String()`, which turns
 * `['cracking','cupping']` into `"cracking,cupping"` and matches no box at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ AN EMPTY LIST BECOMES AN EMPTY STRING, and that is not tidying. `render.ts`
 * refuses an empty array by name: "none of these" is the empty string, an empty
 * list is what a binding that resolved nothing produces, and the two must not
 * look the same. An inspector who opened a multi-select and ticked nothing has
 * answered nothing, which is exactly what the empty string means everywhere
 * else in this file.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING IS DEDUPLICATED OR SORTED. Measured against `render.ts`: it walks
 * the MAP's mappings and asks each one whether the answer names its box, so the
 * order of the list cannot reach the page and a repeated element cannot tick a
 * box twice — `check()` and `drawText` each run once per mapping, never once
 * per element. Normalising here would therefore change nothing on the document
 * while quietly editing what the inspector recorded.
