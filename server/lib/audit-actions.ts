/**
 * The closed vocabulary of audit actions.
 *
 * It lives apart from the writer (`audit.ts`) because it is a different kind of
 * thing: the writer is a handful of functions that rarely change, and this is a
 * list that grows every time the product learns to record something new. Kept
 * together they made one file whose size was governed entirely by the list.
 *
 * Re-exported from `audit.ts`, so every existing importer keeps its import.
 *
 * ⚠️ A member here needs an entry in `audit-registry.ts` — the registry is typed
 * `Record<AuditAction, AuditActionDef>`, so adding a name without one does not
 * compile, and `scripts/check-audit-registry.mjs` walks the other direction.
