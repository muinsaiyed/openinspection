/**
 * The bundle format names two vocabularies that also live elsewhere: the
 * contact-type set (a database column) and the role set (the role taxonomy).
 * An adapter's import graph must stay free of the ORM, which is why the bundle
 * reads the LEAF modules (`people/role-kinds`, `auth/roles`) rather than the
 * schema — and why the agreement with the column is still asserted here rather
 * than asked for in a comment. A comment saying "keep these in sync" is a
 * latent bug.
