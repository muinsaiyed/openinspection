/**
 * StripeService — bring-your-own-keys payment integration.
 *
 * Each tenant connects THEIR OWN Stripe account (test or live); the secret
 * key is loaded per-request from the tenant's encrypted secrets and merged
 * into c.env by integration-secrets middleware. The platform never registers
 * as a payment entity — see docs reference-invoice-payment-flow.
 *
 * Cloudflare Workers compatibility: the Stripe SDK is configured with
 * `createFetchHttpClient()` (no Node http) and webhook verification uses
 * `createSubtleCryptoProvider()` (Web Crypto, async) — the only combination
 * that runs on the V8-isolate runtime.
