/**
 * Produce one statutory form: choose the revision, fetch the published bytes,
 * collect the values, render.
 *
 * Four steps, and each one refuses rather than degrading. That is the whole
 * character of this file, and the reason is the same every time: every failure
 * mode here produces a document that looks entirely correct.
 *
 *   - A revision that does not cover the inspection date is still a real
 *     official form. Rendering "the nearest one" delivers the wrong document
 *     with nothing to distinguish it.
 *   - Bytes that are not the ones the map was authored against still render.
 *     The values simply land in boxes nobody measured.
 *   - A missing object degrades, if you let it, into a blank form -- and a
 *     blank looks exactly like an answer nobody had.
 *
 * So nothing here catches and continues. In particular the check that the
 * bytes are the ones the map was authored against is NOT wrapped -- it is the
 * only voice on this path that can say "these are not the bytes we published".
 * It runs as the renderer's first act rather than as a separate step here; the
 * note at step 4 says why, and the spec beside this file holds the guarantee
 * against THIS function so that moving it cannot quietly lose it.
 *
 * -- WHERE THE REVISIONS COME FROM -------------------------------------------
 * The published catalogue in code (`PUBLISHED_FORM_VERSIONS`), not the
 * `statutory_form_versions` table. Publishing a revision is a person's decision
 * that needs a field map authored against those exact bytes; a row is data that
 * can arrive without one. Verified before writing this: nothing in `server/`
 * reads or writes that table at runtime.
 *
 * -- NOTHING IS WRITTEN BACK, AND THE COST WAS MEASURED ----------------------
 * The rendered PDF is returned, never stored. Storing it would create a new
 * artifact class needing its own erasure rule, retention period and
 * classification, and the form is cheap to rebuild from inputs that are all
 * already durable.
 *
 * "Cheap" is measured, not assumed. In real workerd via vitest-pool-workers
 * (`tests/workers/statutory-render-cost.spec.ts`, 2026-08-27): ten renders of a
 * flat overlay-mapped form cost 24ms in-isolate, 2.4ms each; the first render
 * of a cold isolate reads 7ms. Node is not comparable here and was not used --
 * it over-reports by a workload-dependent factor, so a Node figure cannot be
 * divided down into this one.
 *
 * If a real six-page authority PDF with a large AcroForm moves that by an order
 * of magnitude, the answer is still NOT a cache added here quietly: it is a
 * separate plan for a stored artifact and the four governance entries it needs.
