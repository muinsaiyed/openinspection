     * characters — so the customer's QuickBooks showed a UUID fragment like
     * `9ce7a7ba-c5e0-4678-86` as the document number. A UUID happens to satisfy

     * prefix belong to rendering. Storing the presentation would make a prefix
     * change rewrite history, and would make "which invoice came first" a string
     * comparison.
     *

     * `UPDATE … RETURNING`, because D1 has no interactive transaction and
     * `MAX(number)+1` races two concurrent creates onto the same number.

     * NULLABLE only for rows that predate the column; every new invoice gets
     * one. Appended at END per the D1 add-column-at-end rule.
