/**
 * The template that produces FL OIR-B1-1802, against the map of that form.
 *
 * ── WHAT NO TEST HERE CAN CHECK ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Whether the wording is the Office's. Every `label`, every attribute `name`
 * and every transcribed line of every `description` was read off the published
 * PDF: 169 lines found on the page verbatim and 16 more composed of parts that
 * are, with 16 marked as this template's own voice. A planted line
 * (`Roof Slope: For single family homes…`, the printed text with one hyphen
 * removed) was reported missing, which is what makes the 169 mean something.
 * That check needs the PDF, the PDF is not in this repository, and it is
 * therefore recorded rather than repeated.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT CAN, AND WHY THAT IS THE CRUX ───────────────────────────────────
 * This form's answers are BARE LETTERS — `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `X`, `Z`, `NA` —
 * and `render.ts` matches `value === whenValue` with nothing normalising. A
 * template storing the printed label ("A - Wood frame") instead produces a
 * completely blank official form and nothing throws:
 * `checkChoicesAreReachable` only refuses an answer that WAS given, and boxes
 * nobody chose simply stay unticked.
