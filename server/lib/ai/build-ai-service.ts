/**
 * Assemble the per-request AIService from ONE credential resolution.
 *
 * Modelled on `lib/email/build-email-service.ts`, and here for the same two
 * reasons. First, four seams have to agree about whose key funds a call — the
 * meter's tag, the capability gate's source, the provenance row's mode, and the
 * quota pre-flight's cap — and the only way they cannot disagree is if the
 * question is asked once and the answer handed to all four. Second, that
 * assembly does not belong inside the DI middleware's service switch: it is a
 * policy decision with four dependencies, not a `new`.
 *
 * Nothing here reads deployment mode. Whether a managed credential may exist at
 * all is `profile.hasManagedAi`, answered inside `resolveAi`; whether the dev
 * mock stands in for a missing key is `profile.aiDevMockFallback`.
