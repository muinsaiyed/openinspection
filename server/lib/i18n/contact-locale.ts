/**
 * Which language a contact should be addressed in.
 *
 * A notification is rendered FOR a recipient, and the recipient's language is
 * not the request's language — in a cron or queue context there is no request
 * at all. So the answer cannot come from the ambient locale; it has to be
 * resolved from what we know about that person. This module is the one place
 * that decision is made, so it can be changed once rather than at every
 * sender.
 *
 * PRECEDENCE, highest first:
 *   1. `contactLocale`     — what the contact told us themselves.
 *   2. `linkedUserLocale`  — the locale on the account a contact is bound to
 *                            (`contacts.agent_user_id`); an explicit choice
 *                            too, just made in a different place.
 *   3. `tenantDefault`     — the company's configured locale.
 *   4. `acceptLanguage`    — the browser hint from the request, when there is
 *                            one. Weakest: it describes a device, not a person.
 *   5. `'en'`              — the base locale.
 *
 * Each level FALLS THROUGH when it is absent OR names a language we have no
 * messages for: a contact who stored `fr-FR` gets the tenant's language, not a
 * page of untranslated keys. Never treat NULL at any level as English — the
 * absence is the thing that makes a stored value evidence of demand.

/**
 * The locales the compiled message catalogue actually covers.
 *
 * Restated here rather than imported: `server/` may not import
 * `app/paraglide/**` (BFF boundary, enforced by `no-restricted-imports`), and
 * the only sanctioned crossing is the message wrapper. The equality with
 * `project.inlang/settings.json` is asserted by
 * `tests/unit/contacts/contact-locale.spec.ts`, because a resolver that
 * returns a locale with no messages behind it degrades to English silently.
 *
 * This constant is also read by the booking UI (`app/components/booking/
 * LanguageChoice.tsx`) so the options offered and the values accepted are one
 * list. That makes this module part of the browser bundle: keep it PURE — no
 * DB, no bindings, no `app/paraglide` — exactly as `server/lib/people/
 * capabilities.ts` is kept.
