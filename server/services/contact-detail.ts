/**
 * The contact detail payload (IA-18) — one contact, its inspection history, and
 * the money that history is worth.
 *
 * Extracted from ContactService purely for size: the service crossed the 400-line
 * gate and this was its largest single method, and a self-contained one. It takes
 * an explicit `db` rather than reaching through the service, which is also what
 * lets it be read on its own.
 *
 * The money here is deliberately NOT `inspections.price`. That column is tier 3
 * of the P-4 authority chain, a denormalized cache, and reading it directly is
 * what made this card show "TOTAL REVENUE $450.00" above the very inspection it
 * had just listed at "$0.00 / Unpaid". One invoice pass feeds both readers.
 *
 * ⚠️ REVENUE IS ATTRIBUTED TO ONE CONTACT, BECAUSE IT WAS BILLED TO ONE CONTACT.
 * `totalRevenueCents` used to be "paid invoices on any inspection this contact is
 * attached to", and a contact is attached through `inspection_people` — which
 * names the client, the co-client, the buyer's agent, the listing agent and
 * anyone else on the job. One $450 paid invoice therefore printed as
 * "TOTAL REVENUE $450.00" on the client's record AND on the buyer's agent's, so
 * the only database-wide total was $900 of revenue that a single $450 payment had
 * produced. Summing a per-contact figure is exactly what an operator does with
 * it, so the figure has to be summable.
 *
 * `invoices.contact_id` is the billed party and is set at creation
 * (InvoiceService.resolveContactId: explicit id, else the inspection's primary
 * client, else an email match). One invoice, one billed contact — so revenue
 * keyed on it cannot be counted twice, whoever else stood on the job.
 *
 * The agent's $450 does not disappear. It is reported beside the revenue as
 * `billedToOthersCents` under its own name, because "money paid on a job you
 * referred" is a real and different fact from "money you paid us" — and the
 * defect was never the number, it was two different facts sharing one word.
