/**
 * The override mechanic, shared by both permission axes.

 * Staff capabilities (users.permission_overrides) and contact-role capabilities

 * different bit lists, so they use the same implementation rather than two
 * copies that drift. The JSON-coercion quirk below is exactly the sort of thing
 * that otherwise gets fixed on one side only.
 *
 * Bits declare their shape. An earlier version hardcoded `typeof === 'boolean'`,
 * which would silently drop a three-value bit — configuration accepted, stored,
 * then ignored, which reads to an operator as a broken product.
