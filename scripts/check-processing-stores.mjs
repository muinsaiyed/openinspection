/**
 * lint:processing-stores — every store this worker can reach has a registry entry.
 *
 * `compliance/processing-stores.jsonc` only means something if something reads
 * it. Left unread it is a document, and a document goes stale the first time
 * somebody adds a binding — which is precisely the failure it was written to
 * end, since the existing compliance gates read one filesystem input (the
 * Drizzle table directory) and so could only ever see database columns.
 *
 * ── Why this parses JSONC instead of grepping it ────────────────────────────
 * The first draft of this gate matched bindings with two regexes:
 *
 *     "binding"\s*:\s*"([A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*)"
 *     "name"\s*:\s*"([a-z0-9-]+)"[^}]*"class_name"
 *
 * Run against the real configs they returned 14 names. Seventeen exist. The
 * four Durable Objects were missed because their binding is declared under
 * `name` in UPPER_SNAKE, which the second pattern's character class excludes;
 * RATE_LIMITER was missed because it lives in `unsafe.bindings` and has no
 * `class_name`; and two of the fourteen were not bindings at all but the
 * `name` field of the workflow whose binding had already been counted.
 *
 * A gate that undercounts its own input is the exact shape this repository
 * keeps rediscovering: it prints a confident number, the number is wrong, and
 * nothing about a green run says which. INSPECTION_DOC — the store with no
 * deletion path, the reason this program exists — was one of the five it
 * silently dropped. So the configs are parsed as JSON with comments stripped
 * and the whole tree is walked, which cannot miss a binding table nobody
 * remembered to enumerate. `stream` was such a table.
 *
 * ── Four inputs, four pairs of numbers, never merged ────────────────────────
 * Bindings, consumed queues and external processors are counted separately
 * because they fail differently: a platform binding count reading "complete"
 * while the email and AI sub-processors stayed invisible is a full-looking
 * registry that omits everyone data actually leaves the estate to. Env vars
 * are the fourth and are checked by ATTRIBUTION rather than by their own
 * entries — STREAM_CUSTOMER_SUBDOMAIN configures the STREAM store and does not
 * deserve a second row of its own.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-processing-stores.mjs [--self-test]
