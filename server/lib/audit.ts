 * Metadata redaction — applied at BOTH insert sites in this file (#276).

 * send, a property address on an inspection update. The same call was made on
 * the portal's identical column (`audit_logs.details`): carrying such a column
 * through an erasure is an incomplete DSAR. This is the write-time half of the
 * answer; the erasure half is the `audit_logs.metadata` anonymize rule in
 * `compliance/erasure-manifest.ts`, and it is the half that is complete.
 *
 * The primary filter is on the VALUE, not the key: a string that IS an email
 * address, a phone number or an IP is removed wherever it appears and whatever
 * it is called. That is what holds when someone adds a field — a list of key
 * names lets the next one through by construction.
 *
 * The short key list below covers what has no detectable value shape. A street
 * address or a person's name is not recognisable as a string, so only the key
 * can flag it, and dropping metadata wholesale is not available: these rows
 * exist for what it says (the previous token hash on a portal_access rotation,
 * the before/after capability sets on a role change). So the list is
 * deliberately narrow, knowingly incomplete, and NOT the reason the column is
 * safe to keep — the manifest rule is.
 *
 * It is deliberately not portal's list either. Portal matches `name`, `token`
 * and a bare `ip`, which here would redact the tag / template / rating-system
 * names that ARE the audit value of half these events, the rotation forensics
 * in `previousTokenHash`, and every key containing the letters "ip"
 * (`zipPrefixes`, `description`).

/**
 * Sprint B-3 — actions that ought to carry inspector_slug for cross-inspection

 * edits) intentionally leave the column NULL so the index stays signal-rich.
 *
 * ⚠️ The list was written to be forward-compatible — "when emitters for these
 * events appear, call writeAuditLogWithSlug" — and closing `AuditAction` turned
 * that into a contradiction. FOUR of the six names below are not members of the
 * union (`user.slug.set`, `inspection.created`, `invoice.sent`, `invoice.paid`),
 * so no caller can pass them any more, and `agreement.sent` is declared
 * `in-esign-log` — its record is the hash-chained row, not an `audit_logs` one.
 *
 * `inspection.published` is the one that changed: it joined the union with a
 * `live` registry entry when the publish route started emitting it. That closes
 * half the gap and leaves the other half visible — the emitter is
 * `auditFromContext`, which writes through `writeAuditRow` and never touches
 * `inspector_slug`. So the column is still NULL on every row, now because of the
 * WRITER rather than the vocabulary. Routing publish through
 * `writeAuditLogWithSlug` instead would populate it and lose `actorKind` /
 * `platformActorId`, which matters more on a publish: a support session shipping
 * a workspace's report must not read as the workspace doing it. Closing this
 * properly means teaching one writer both, not swapping which half is missing.
 *
 * It is a `Set<string>` rather than `Set<AuditAction>` deliberately, so this
 * file states the gap instead of hiding it behind a cast; pinned by
 * `tests/unit/tenancy/audit-inspector-slug.spec.ts`.
