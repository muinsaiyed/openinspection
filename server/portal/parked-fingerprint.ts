/**
 * What a parked command row holds: a FINGERPRINT, never the payload (#276).
 *
 * `cmd.tenant.update` carries `adminEmail` + `adminPasswordHash` SPARSELY —
 * only password-change commands do (see `applyCredentialIfFresh`). Parking the
 * message therefore wrote an admin credential into a table nothing pruned, no
 * erasure rule covered, and no PII heuristic flagged: `envelope` and `reason`
 * look like nothing. Both parking paths did it — the raw string on a parse
 * failure, `JSON.stringify(env)` on an unknown type/version.
 *
 * The table exists so a human learns that portal and core disagree about a
 * command shape. That question is answered by WHICH command, WHICH version,
 * WHERE in the tenant sequence, HOW BIG it was, WHETHER the bytes match what
 * the sender recorded, and — when it would not parse — WHICH envelope fields
 * were wrong. None of those is the payload.
 *
 * The fields below are an ALLOW-LIST read through primitive type guards, not a
 * redaction pass over the message: a field added to `data` tomorrow is dropped
 * because nothing reads it, not because someone remembered to name it.
