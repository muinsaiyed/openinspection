/**
 * HTML5 drag-and-drop for Playwright.
 *
 * Playwright's `locator.dragTo()` and any hand-rolled `mouse.down/move/up`
 * synthesize POINTER events. `dragstart` / `dragover` / `drop` are browser-native
 * gestures the automation protocol does not initiate, so they are simply never
 * emitted — a surface built on HTML5 DnD sits perfectly still and the spec reads
 * as a product bug rather than a harness gap.
 *
 * The dispatch board (and the calendar's day/week/month views) are built on
 * HTML5 DnD and read the dragged id back off `dataTransfer`, so a spec that
 * cannot produce a real `DataTransfer` cannot exercise them at all.
 *
 * What this does instead: construct one `DataTransfer` in the page, stash it on
 * `window`, and dispatch each real `DragEvent` against it in turn. The stash is
 * what makes it a GESTURE rather than four unrelated events — the drop handler
 * reads back exactly what the dragstart handler wrote, which is the contract
 * under test.
 *
 * The four steps are dispatched in SEPARATE evaluate round trips on purpose.
 * Fired in one synchronous block, React never re-renders between them, so
 * anything driven by state set in `dragstart` (the board's hover indicator, and
 * its `onDragOver` early-return) is dead. Separate trips let the render land,
 * which is what a real drag does across frames.
