/**
 * The Report Access panel makes a claim about access control, so its three
 * states have to stay distinguishable.
 *
 * The bug: `GET /{id}/access` returned 400, the loader caught it into an empty
 * array, and the page rendered "This contact cannot open any reports" for a
 * contact holding two live links. A failure was displayed as an authoritative
 * negative — the dangerous direction here, because an operator checking who can
 * still open a report acts on that answer.
 *
 * Same shape at the other end: the revoke action returns the number ACTUALLY
 * revoked (which can be lower than asked, when a link had already lapsed) and
 * nothing rendered it, so a failed revoke and a successful one looked alike.
