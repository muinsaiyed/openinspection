/**
 * `/settings/imports` — the list of import runs, and the entry points that
 * start one.
 *
 * Every assertion here is written against state that ONLY this page's own
 * behaviour produces. "A table renders" is true of any page with a table, so
 * the four things pinned instead are:
 *
 *   1. a ROW belongs to the run it came from — its intent, its source, its
 *      status and its link are read back together, and the other row is
 *      checked NOT to carry them, because a page that renders the same row
 *      twice passes every single-row assertion;
 *   2. the empty state appears when and only when there are no runs (the
 *      populated case is asserted to NOT show it — an empty state that is
 *      always mounted is the shape this catches);
 *   3. each entry point goes somewhere DIFFERENT, asserted as a set of three
 *      distinct hrefs rather than three separate "a link exists" checks;
 *   4. the submit control states its own blocking condition as a sentence
 *      naming the first thing to fix reading down the form, and the sentence
 *      CHANGES as each condition is met. A disabled button asserted only as
 *      `disabled` would pass while saying nothing.
 *
 * The assisted entry point is gated on a deployment capability, so it gets a
 * positive control in both directions plus the fail-closed case where the
 * session carries no `deployment` block at all — the shape that replaced
 * `/library` with "Unexpected Application Error!" once already.
