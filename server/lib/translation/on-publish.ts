/**
 * The publish-time hook for a courtesy translation.
 *
 * Kept out of both publish modules on purpose. `server/api/inspections/publish.ts`
 * and `server/services/inspection/inspection-publish.service.ts` are each at
 * their large-file cap, and — more usefully — publishing is about whether a
 * document is finished, while this is about whether a second copy of it gets
 * produced. Two questions, two files.
 *
 * ## Per-report opt-in, default OFF
 *
 * Nothing here decides to translate. Production costs money and the decision
 * stays with whoever incurs it, so a translation is produced only when the
 * publisher asked for one on this publish. A workspace-level switch gates
 * whether the request may be honoured at all; it never makes the request.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SWITCH GATES PRODUCTION, NEVER CONSUMPTION. Turning the feature off
 * must not alter a single already-published report. That invariant lives on the
 * READER side — reader paths answer from stored rows and never consult a tenant
 * setting — and the only thing this module may do with the switch is decline to
 * make a new row.
 *
 * ## Failure is not a failed publish
 *
 * A translation that could not be produced leaves the English report published
 * and correct, which is the state the whole feature degrades to by design. So
 * this never throws into the publish path: it reports what happened and the
 * caller records it.
