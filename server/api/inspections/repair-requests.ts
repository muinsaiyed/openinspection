/**
 * #69 — the Repair Request Log: the inspection company's READ of the repair
 * request lists its clients and their agents built from a published report.
 *
 * Every other repair route lives on `/api/public` and authenticates a share
 * token, a portal token or an owner-preview JWT (`lib/repair-access.ts`). This
 * one does not: its caller is staff on an ordinary session, its answer spans
 * lists the caller did not author, and it must never be reachable with a token
 * a client could forward. So it sits under `/api/inspections`, behind the
 * global JWT gate and `requireRole`, and reads the tenant from the verified
 * claims — the URL's `:id` names the inspection, never the tenant.
 *
 * READ ONLY, and there is no sibling write. The industry answer is a log the
 * inspector goes and looks at: Spectora's RRB Log is view-only, and the
 * respondable flow the other vendor ships belongs to the buyer's agent, not to
 * the inspection company. A reply from the company on the buyer's own
 * negotiating document is a different product decision, not this endpoint's
 * missing half.
