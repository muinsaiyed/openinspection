# Design System — Tokens, Components, Conformance

OpenInspection ships with a small, opinionated design system ("Design System
0523") rather than raw Tailwind utilities. It has three layers:

1. **Token layer** — CSS custom properties + a Tailwind v4 `@theme` block
   (`app/styles/tailwind.css`) that map semantic names (`bg-ih-bg-card`,
   `text-ih-fg-2`, `bg-ih-ok`) to real colors, and flip automatically for dark
   mode.
2. **Component primitives** — `packages/shared-ui/src/` — a small set of
   token-based React components (Button, Card, Modal, Input, ...) shared by
   both the standalone engine and (via the package) any SaaS overlay.
3. **Conformance tooling** — `npm run lint:ds` (`scripts/check-ds-tokens.mjs`)
   fails the build when UI code bypasses the token layer with raw Tailwind
   palette classes.

If you're adding or changing UI, this doc is the reference for what exists
today — don't invent new tokens or components ad hoc; extend what's here.

---

## 1. Token layer

All tokens are CSS custom properties, declared once in `app/styles/tailwind.css`
and re-exposed as Tailwind utilities via a `@theme` block (so `bg-ih-primary`,
`text-ih-fg-1`, etc. work as ordinary Tailwind classes). Components must
consume tokens, not literal colors — dark mode is then "free": swapping the
`:root` custom properties is enough, no per-component dark-mode code needed.

### Color tokens

| Token | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--color-ih-primary` / `-600` / `-700` | Brand color + hover/active shades. The **FILL** role: button and accent-bar backgrounds. A tenant's brand color lands here verbatim |
| `--color-ih-primary-text` | The **TEXT** role: links, tab labels, brand-colored glyphs. Equal to `--color-ih-primary` by default, but when a tenant sets a brand color this one is derived — the same hue and saturation, moved along the lightness axis until it clears 4.5:1 on the card (darker on light themes, lighter on dark). 63.6% of sRGB fails AA as text on white, so the two roles cannot share one value. Use `text-ih-primary` **only** where the brand is the fill of the thing being colored, e.g. a checkbox accent |
| `--color-ih-primary-tint` | Low-opacity primary wash (selected tab pill, badges) |
| `--color-ih-primary-glow` | Focus-ring glow color (see `shadow-ih-focus`) |
| `--color-ih-primary-fg` | Foreground for content on `bg-ih-primary`; defaults to white, but flips to dark text per-surface when a bright custom brand color is set. Chosen by measuring both candidates' real WCAG ratios and taking the higher — 6.7% of sRGB admits no passing choice at all, so this is a best-effort token, not a guarantee |
| `--color-ih-fg-1` … `-5` | Text scale from near-black/white (`-1`, headings/body) down to faint (`-5`, disabled/hairline) |
| `--color-ih-fg-inverse` | Text on an inverted surface (`bg-ih-bg-inverse`, `bg-ih-primary`) |
| `--color-ih-bg-app` | Page background |
| `--color-ih-bg-card` | Card/panel/input surface |
| `--color-ih-bg-muted` | Subtle fill (badges, disabled zones, hover rows) |
| `--color-ih-bg-inverse` | Inverted surface (tooltips, photo-studio chrome) |
| `--color-ih-border` / `-strong` | Hairline border / emphasized border |
| `--color-ih-agent-accent` / `-fg` | Sub-brand accent reserved for the Agent portal surface |

### Status tones

Four semantic tones, each with a `-bg` (tint) and `-fg` (text/icon) pair:
`ih-ok`, `ih-watch`, `ih-bad`, `ih-info`. Use these for anything that
communicates state — never reach for a raw `emerald-500` or `red-600`.

| Tone | Meaning | Example usage |
|---|---|---|
| `ih-ok` | Satisfactory / success | "Satisfactory" rating pill, success toast accent |
| `ih-watch` | Needs monitoring / warning | "Monitor" rating pill, warning banners |
| `ih-bad` | Defect / error | "Defect" rating pill, error toast accent, form field errors |
| `ih-info` | Informational | Info banners, neutral callouts |

### Shadows

Exactly two elevations exist — do not use Tailwind's `shadow-sm/md/lg/xl/2xl`:

| Token | Use |
|---|---|
| `shadow-ih-card` | Resting elevation for cards/panels |
| `shadow-ih-popover` | Elevated overlays — `Modal`, dropdowns, toasts |
| `shadow-ih-focus` | Focus ring (`0 0 0 3px var(--ih-primary-glow)`) — applied via `focus:shadow-ih-focus` |

### Radius

Five semantic corner radii — do not use raw `rounded-md/lg/xl` or arbitrary
`rounded-[10px]` in components (`lint:ds` flags the latter):

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `rounded-ih-pill` | 4px | Pills, segment buttons, small chips |
| `rounded-ih-button` | 6px | Buttons, icon buttons, segmented-control track |
| `rounded-ih-input` | 8px | Text inputs (the `.ih-input` base radius) |
| `rounded-ih-card` | 8px | Cards, banners, popovers, panels |
| `rounded-ih-modal` | 12px | Modal dialog corners |

### Spacing

Two named spacing tokens capture recurring rhythms; use the standard Tailwind
scale for everything else. Arbitrary px spacing (`p-[18px]`, `gap-[2px]`) is
flagged by `lint:ds`:

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `space-y-ih-list` / `gap-ih-list` / `p-ih-list` | 18px | Vertical rhythm between list rows / page sections |
| `p-ih-card` / `gap-ih-card` | 14px | Compact card padding |

(These are `@theme` spacing extensions, so they work with any spacing utility —
`p-`, `px-`, `gap-`, `space-y-`, `m-`, etc.)

### Backdrop (overlay scrim)

| Token | Use |
|---|---|
| `bg-ih-backdrop` | The single canonical overlay scrim — a fixed dark wash (`rgba(15,23,42,0.55)` light / `rgba(2,6,23,0.65)` dark) behind full-screen dialogs |

`Modal` and `Drawer` both render `bg-ih-backdrop` as their full-screen scrim;
`Popover` deliberately has **no** scrim (it is an anchored, non-blocking
overlay). Never hand-roll a scrim with `bg-[rgba(...)]` or `backdrop-blur` —
both are flagged by `lint:ds`; use this token.

### Fonts

`font-ih-display` (Bricolage Grotesque, headings), `font-ih-body` (Inter,
default body), `font-ih-mono` (JetBrains Mono, `.ih-kbd` and code).

### Dark mode

The `data-color-scheme` attribute on `<html>` selects the palette:
`"light"` (default), `"dark"`, or `"field"`. `useTheme()`
(`app/hooks/useTheme.ts`) is the single place that resolves the user's
preference (including `"auto"` → OS media query) and writes the attribute —
components never branch on scheme themselves. Do not use Tailwind's
`dark:` variant for OpenInspection colors; token consumption makes it
redundant (the `.dark` class is still added alongside `data-color-scheme` so
plain `dark:` utilities keep working for third-party components that need
them).

`"field"` is a first-class third scheme (not just "auto → dark"): a
high-contrast, large-type (18px base) variant of dark for outdoor/sunlight
field use. It inherits the dark palette and overrides foregrounds, background,
and borders for higher contrast.

### How to add a token

1. Add the CSS custom property to both the `:root` block (light) and the
   `html[data-color-scheme="dark"]` block (dark) in `app/styles/tailwind.css`
   — every token needs a value in both, or dark mode silently falls back to
   the light value.
2. Expose it as a Tailwind utility by adding a matching line to the `@theme`
   block (`--color-ih-foo: var(--ih-foo);`). **Step 2 is not optional.**
   Without it `bg-ih-foo` is not an error — Tailwind emits no CSS for it and
   says nothing, so the element paints no background in every theme. Ten alias
   names shipped in that state, one of them at 17 call sites.
3. Consume it as `bg-ih-foo` / `text-ih-foo` / etc. Never reference the raw
   `--ih-foo` CSS variable directly from a component unless there is no
   Tailwind utility surface for it (e.g. inline `style={{ boxShadow: ... }}`).
   Mind the namespace: `bg-`/`text-`/`border-` read `--color-*`, `rounded-`
   reads `--radius-*`, `p-`/`gap-` read `--spacing-*`, `shadow-` reads
   `--shadow-*`. `ih-card` exists in three of those, so `shadow-ih-card`
   resolves and `bg-ih-card` does not.
4. Run `npm run lint:ds`. It fails on an `ih-*` alias with no `@theme` entry
   (step 2 above) and on raw palette classes. It has nothing to say about what
   the token is WORTH — `npm run lint:contrast` is the gate that does the
   arithmetic.

## 2. Typography & utility classes

A handful of non-component CSS utility classes live in `tailwind.css` for
patterns that recur across many components:

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.ih-eyebrow` | 9px, bold, uppercase, letter-spaced label style (used by the deprecated `Eyebrow` component and a few standalone labels) |
| `.ih-input` | The canonical 36px-tall block input style (border, radius, focus ring). `Input` and most raw `<input>`/`<select>` field markup in `app/` build on this class directly |
| `.ih-kbd` | Keyboard-shortcut chip (monospace, bordered) |
| `.ih-pill` (+ `--sat` / `--monitor` / `--defect` / `--ni`) | Base pill shape; the shared-ui `Pill` component composes this with a `tone` prop — prefer the component over the raw class in new code |
| `.ih-row` / `.ih-row__hover` | Hover-reveal pattern: child marked `.ih-row__hover` is invisible until the `.ih-row` ancestor is hovered or has `.is-active` |
| `.ih-sidebar` | Sidebar width transition, driven by `html[data-sidebar-collapsed]` |

Use these for the exact pattern they name. For anything else, compose
Tailwind utilities from the token layer directly (`text-[13px] text-ih-fg-2
font-bold`, etc.) — there is no separate general-purpose typography scale
beyond the ad hoc pixel sizes already used throughout `app/components/`.

---

## 3. Component primitives

`packages/shared-ui/src/` — everything exported from `index.ts`, which is the
authoritative list; the table below describes each one. **Check there before
hand-rolling UI.** A new repeated pattern (a card variant used in
three places, a new pill tone) belongs in `shared-ui`, not copy-pasted across
route files.

| Component | Purpose | Key props / variants |
|---|---|---|
| `Button` | Primary interactive control | `variant`: `primary` \| `secondary` \| `ghost` \| `danger` \| `link` \| `danger-link`; `size`: `sm` \| `md` \| `lg`; `icon`; `selected` (sets `aria-pressed` + a pressed ring — for toggle affordances). `link`/`danger-link` are borderless text actions (no fill/border) |
| `IconButton` | Square icon-only button — same variants as `Button`, no text padding; `aria-label` is required (TS-enforced) | `aria-label` (**required**), `variant`: `primary` \| `secondary` \| `ghost` (default) \| `danger`; `size`: `sm` (28px) \| `md` (36px) \| `lg` (44px); `selected` (`aria-pressed` toggle). Use for toolbar/close/settings glyph buttons instead of a hand-rolled `w-9 h-9 flex` `<button>` |
| `MenuItem` | Dropdown-row primitive to pair with `Popover` | `role="menuitem"`, full-width left-aligned; `icon`, `tone`: `default` \| `danger`, `disabled`, `onClick`. Use for popover/dropdown menu rows instead of hand-rolled `w-full text-left px-3 py-1.5 hover:bg-ih-bg-muted` `<button>`s |
| `Pill` | Small status/tag chip | `tone`: `sat` \| `monitor` \| `defect` \| `ni` \| `np` \| `info` \| `gen` \| `primary` \| `neutral` \| `warning`; `dot` (leading dot) |
| `Icon` | Inline SVG icon from a fixed named set | `name` (see `ICON_PATHS` in `Icon.tsx` for the full list — dashboard, calendar, check, edit, camera, ...), `size`, `strokeWidth` |
| `Card` | Bordered/rounded/elevated surface container | no variants — compose with `className` |
| `Input` | Labeled text input built on `.ih-input` | `label`, `error` (red border + message), `hint` (shown only when no error) |
| `Textarea` | Labeled multiline input — same `.ih-input` chrome as `Input` but grows with `rows` and resizes vertically | `label`, `error`, `hint`, `rows` (default 3), `bare` (raw control only, for inline composition) |
| `Select` | Labeled single/multi select mirroring `Input`'s chrome; tokenized chevron in single-select mode | `label`, `error`, `hint`, `options` (`SelectOption[]`) or native `<option>` children, `multiple`, `bare`. Use for a fixed option list; use `Input` for free text |
| `Checkbox` | Single checkbox with native `<label>` association; DS `accent-ih-primary` fill | `label`, `error`, `bare` (raw input only, e.g. inside `FormField`) |
| `Radio` / `RadioGroup` | `RadioGroup` renders a `<fieldset>`/`role=radiogroup` set of options; `Radio` is the single control for custom layouts | `RadioGroup`: `name`, `value`, `onChange(value)`, `options` (`RadioOption[]`), `legend`, `error`, `hint`. Prefer `RadioGroup`; reach for bare `Radio` only for bespoke layouts |
| `RadioCardGroup` | Card-style single select — a vertical stack of bordered cards, each a native `<label>`/`<input type=radio>`, with a title and optional description and badge. Selected card lifts to `border-ih-primary` | `name`, `value`, `onChange(value)`, `options` (`RadioCardOption[]` — `value`, `title`, `description`, `badge`, `disabled`), `legend`, `error`, `hint`. Arrow/Home/End move selection, skipping disabled options. Use when an option needs a description or a badge; use `SegmentedControl` or `RadioGroup` for short bare labels |
| `Modal` | Centered dialog overlay (`role="dialog"` + `aria-modal`), full-screen `bg-ih-backdrop` scrim, Escape-to-close, click-outside-to-close, focus trap | `open`, `onClose`, `title`, `size`: `sm` \| `md` \| `lg` \| `xl`, `footer`. Use for confirm/decision moments and short forms (see §4) |
| `Drawer` | Right-side slide-in panel sharing `Modal`'s dialog behavior + scrim | `open`, `onClose`, `title`, `footer`, `wide` (480px vs 360px; mobile always full-width), `initialFocusRef`. Use for "adjust while seeing the page" flows — filters, long side forms — NOT confirm moments (see §4) |
| `Popover` | Anchored, non-blocking floating panel — no scrim, no scroll-lock, no hard focus-trap; Esc / click-outside close, focus restores to the anchor | `open`, `onClose`, `anchorRef` (trigger the panel positions against), `align`: `left` \| `right` (default `right`). Use for lightweight in-context choices (column toggles, dropdowns) where the page must stay visible (see §4) |
| `EmptyState` | Centered icon + title + description + action for empty lists | `icon`, `title`, `description`, `action` |
| `Eyebrow` | **Deprecated** small label chip (bg tint + text) | `color`: `slate` \| `indigo` \| `emerald` \| `amber` \| `rose` — kept for back-compat; new pages use a breadcrumb + a `Pill` in `PageHeader`'s `meta` instead |
| `PageHeader` | Page title row with optional meta line and trailing actions | `title`, `meta`, `actions`; `eyebrow`/`eyebrowColor` are deprecated (same reason as `Eyebrow`) |
| `Pagination` | Page-number nav + page-size selector | `page`, `pageSize`, `total`, `totalPages`, `onPageChange`, `onPageSizeChange`, `pageSizeOptions` |
| `Skeleton` | Loading placeholder block | `variant`: `text` \| `block`, `width` |
| `TabStrip` | Underline-style tab bar with optional counts | `tabs` (`{id, label, count?}[]`), `activeId`, `onChange`, `orientation`: `horizontal` (default, underline) \| `vertical` (left border-accent) |
| `FileDropzone` | Drag-and-drop / click-to-pick file input with a full state machine (idle → drag-over → busy → selected → error) | `accept`, `onFile`, `fileName`/`fileSize` (controlled selection display), `busy`, `error`, `hint`, `onClear`. Also exports `firstFileFromDrop`, `formatFileSize`, `truncateMiddle` helpers |
| `Banner` | Full-width inline status/notice strip with ARIA live-region role (`alert` for warn/danger, `status` otherwise) | `tone`: `info` \| `warn` \| `danger` \| `success` \| `brand`; `actions`, `dismissible`/`onDismiss`, `icon`, `sticky`. Use for page-level or section-level messages; use `Pill` for a compact inline badge, a toast for a transient async outcome |
| `Table` | Generic column-config data table (tokenized header, hover rows, empty-state slot) | `columns` (`TableColumn<T>[]` — `label`, `align`, `cell`, `key`), `rows`, `empty`, `getRowKey`, `onRowClick`. Use for tabular listings instead of hand-rolled `<table>` markup |
| `SegmentedControl` | Single-select segmented toggle (WAI-ARIA radiogroup — roving tabindex, Arrow/Home/End keys) | `options` (`SegmentedControlOption[]` — `value`, `label`, `icon`, `title`), `value`, `onChange(value)`, `size`: `sm` \| `md`, `ariaLabel`. Use for a small set of mutually exclusive views/modes; use `TabStrip` for page navigation |
| `Avatar` | User initials/status chip; consolidates the app's initials logic (`avatarInitials` helper is exported) | `name` (initials derived), `size`: `28` \| `32` \| `36`, `variant`: `flat` \| `self` (gradient), `statusDot`, `ring`, `fallbackIcon` |
| `StatCard` | Compact metric card (label + large value + optional hint), optional left-accent tone bar reusing the `Pill` tone palette | `label`, `value`, `tone` (`PillTone`), `hint` |

`Eyebrow` and `PageHeader`'s `eyebrow`/`eyebrowColor` props are deprecated but
still shipped for back-compat — don't use them on new pages.

### Helper text: `ih-fg-3`, never `ih-fg-4`

Hints, descriptions and other 11px small print use **`text-ih-fg-3`**.
`ih-fg-4` is a *decoration* tier — chevrons, dividers, offline dots,
placeholders — not a text tier: at 11px it measures 2.56:1 on a light card and
3.07:1 on a dark one, against WCAG AA's 4.5:1 for normal-size text. `ih-fg-3`
clears it in all three themes (4.76:1 light, 5.71:1 dark, 12.02:1 field).

On `bg-ih-bg-muted` even `ih-fg-3` falls short (4.34:1 in light), so a chip or
pill that paints its own muted background takes **`text-ih-fg-2`**.

`lint:ds` cannot see this — it validates token *names*, and `ih-fg-4` is a
legitimate name. `npm run lint:contrast` (`scripts/check-contrast.mjs`) does the
arithmetic instead, and runs in pre-commit and CI. It reads four things, not just
class strings: utility class strings, **class fragments inside a template
literal's `${…}`** (the size is usually in the template around them), **colours
set in this stylesheet's own rules** (`.ih-eyebrow`, `.ih-kbd`, `.ih-pill--*`),
and the token VALUES themselves. Every run prints a checked count *and* a skipped
count per dimension — read both; a verdict alone does not say how much of the
tree was looked at.

### Text on a filled brand button: `ih-primary-fg`

`bg-ih-primary` is a different colour in each theme, so the foreground that sits
on it is a per-theme token too — `--ih-primary-fg`, declared in all three blocks
and checked against `--ih-primary` by `TOKEN_INVARIANTS`. It has no `@theme`
fallback on purpose: it once had one, was declared nowhere, and therefore painted
a single fixed colour in every theme, which can only be correct in one of them.
`brandTokens()` re-points it per tenant at request time by measured ratio.

`text-ih-fg-inverse` is **not** a substitute on a surface that does not follow
the theme. It flips between near-white and near-black, so on fixed-dark chrome
(the photo studio) it disappears in half the themes; those surfaces use raw
`white/*` behind a `ds-allow` comment.

## 4. Interaction patterns

Two container shapes cover essentially every editable field in the app:
**inline editing** (no submit button) and **forms** (explicit Save/submit).
Getting this choice right matters more than pixel details — it's the
difference between an editor that feels fluid and one that feels bureaucratic
in the wrong places, or reckless in the wrong others.

### Inline editing (no submit button)

Use inline editing **only when ALL of these hold**:

1. **Single, self-contained field** — no cross-field validation or
   dependencies.
2. **Auto-save semantics** — the value persists on change/blur (or flows into
   the editor draft handled by the sync layer); a save failure surfaces as an
   error toast without interrupting typing.
3. **Continuous workflow** — the edit happens inline with surrounding context
   that must stay visible (renaming a section, rating items, writing report
   narratives).
4. **Low risk, no side effects** — saving never sends, publishes, creates an
   entity, or bills.

Canonical examples in this repo:

- **Template editor section title** — `app/components/template/SectionAuthorHeader.tsx`:
  a transparent-background `<input>` with a focus underline
  (`border-b-2 border-transparent focus:border-ih-primary`), committing on
  every keystroke via `renameSection`.
- **Inspection editor field entry** — `app/components/form/FormField.tsx`:
  each item type (`text`, `number`, `select`, `boolean`, ...) renders a bare
  controlled input wired straight to `onChange`; there is no per-field save
  button, the value flows into the inspection's sync layer.
- **PCA narrative textareas** — same pattern, a `textarea` with
  `onChange`-driven persistence for free-text report narrative.

**Only two inline input visual styles are sanctioned** — do not invent a
third:

1. **Transparent title style**: `bg-transparent border-b-2 border-transparent
   focus:border-ih-primary outline-none` — for large, title-like inline text
   (section titles, item labels).
2. **`.ih-input` block style**: the bordered, `bg-ih-bg-card` block input —
   for ordinary field values (`FormField` renderers, most `Input` usage).

### Forms (explicit Save/submit)

A form is **required when ANY of these hold**:

1. **Multiple fields submitted together**, or cross-field validation/
   dependencies.
2. **Submission has side effects** — sends email/SMS, publishes, creates an
   entity, charges money.
3. **Explicit confirmation semantics are needed** — a Save/Cancel pair, or an
   unsaved-changes guard.

**Rule of thumb: if an "unsaved state" can exist, it's a form; a single field
that saves on blur can be edited inline.**

Container choice:

- **Page-level forms** for settings-style surfaces — see
  `app/routes/settings-workspace.tsx`: a React Router `action` + Zod schema
  (`workspaceSchema`) via `@conform-to/react`/`@conform-to/zod`, with
  `useForm({ shouldValidate: "onBlur", shouldRevalidate: "onInput" })` — this
  is the **eager-after-error** pattern: don't validate until the field is
  first touched/blurred, then revalidate on every subsequent change so the
  error clears as soon as the user fixes it.
- **`Modal`** for short or critical confirmations (destructive actions,
  small single-purpose dialogs) — build on the shared `Modal` component's
  `footer` slot for the Save/Cancel button pair.

### Overlay containers — Modal vs Drawer vs Popover

Three overlay primitives cover three distinct intents. Picking the wrong one is
the usual cause of "this feels heavy/interrupting" complaints:

| Primitive | Shape | Scrim / blocking | Use it for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Modal` | Centered dialog | Full-screen `bg-ih-backdrop` scrim + focus trap — **interrupts** the page | Confirm/decision moments (destructive actions), short single-purpose forms |
| `Drawer` | Right-side slide-in panel | Same full-screen scrim + focus trap, but content stays anchored to the edge | Longer/complex side forms and "adjust while the page context is still framed" flows (filters, settings sub-panels) |
| `Popover` | Small panel anchored to a trigger | **No scrim, no scroll-lock, no hard focus-trap** — the page stays visible and interactive | Lightweight in-context choices (column toggles, dropdown menus, quick pickers) |

Rules of thumb:

- If the user must **stop and answer** before continuing → `Modal`.
- If they're **filling a longer form but the page behind it still gives useful
  context** → `Drawer`.
- If it's a **quick, low-stakes pick anchored to a button** and the rest of the
  page should stay live → `Popover`.

`Drawer` deliberately reuses `Modal`'s dialog chrome (`useDialogBehavior`:
scroll-lock, focus-trap, Escape/click-outside close). `Popover` intentionally
does **not** — it reimplements Esc/click-outside close and focus capture/restore
without the trap or scroll-lock, because those would be wrong for a non-blocking
anchored panel.

### Toasts

`app/hooks/useToast.ts` (`pushToast`) + `app/components/Toast.tsx`
(`ToastPortal`, mounted once near the root). Three variants:

| Variant | Visual | When |
|---|---|---|
| `neutral` (default) | Plain card, no accent | Informational, low-stakes confirmations (e.g. "Entered next section: Roof") |
| `success` | Left accent bar in `ih-ok` | A background action completed (e.g. photo upload succeeded) |
| `error` | Left accent bar in `ih-bad` + inline `!` marker | A background/auto-save action failed (e.g. "Save failed — your last change did NOT reach the server") |

Toast vs. inline error: toast a **background/async** outcome the user isn't
actively looking at (auto-save, background upload); show an **inline** error
(the `Input`/`FormField` `error` prop, or a form's field-level Zod error) when
the user is actively looking at the field that failed validation.

Toasts also support an optional `actionLabel`/`onAction` (e.g. "Undo" after a
batch rating change) and a caller-specified `durationMs`.

### Never use native dialogs

Never use `window.confirm` / `window.alert` / `window.prompt` for
confirmations — always use the shared `Modal` component with explicit
Save/Cancel (or Confirm/Cancel) actions in its `footer`.

## 5. Conformance tooling — `npm run lint:ds`

`scripts/check-ds-tokens.mjs` scans `app/` and `packages/shared-ui/src/`. Nine
violation classes live in its `RULES` array, and a tenth check — every `ih-*`
alias resolves to a `@theme` entry — runs beside them (that is the one "How to
add a token" step 4 describes):

1. **Dead `-bg0` pseudo-token** — `ih-(ok|watch|bad|primary)-bg0` generates no
   utility and silently ships invisible elements.
2. **Raw palette utilities** — any Tailwind color-prefixed class
   (`bg-`/`text-`/`border-`/`ring-`/`shadow-`/... ) against a raw hue
   (`slate`, `red`, `indigo`, `emerald`, ...) with a numeric shade, e.g.
   `bg-slate-200`, `text-indigo-600`. These bypass dark mode and the brand
   hue entirely.
3. **Literal `bg-white` / `bg-black`** on in-app surfaces.
4. **Non-token shadows** — `shadow-sm|md|lg|xl|2xl`. Only `shadow-ih-card` and
   `shadow-ih-popover` are sanctioned.
5. **Arbitrary radius** — `rounded-[10px]` and friends. Use the semantic radii
   (`rounded-ih-pill|button|input|card|modal`).
6. **Arbitrary px spacing** — arbitrary-value padding/margin/gap/space like
   `p-[18px]`, `gap-[2px]`. Use the standard Tailwind scale or the
   `ih-list`/`ih-card` spacing tokens. (Width/height/inset and `min-`/`max-`
   dimensions are legitimately bespoke and are **not** flagged.)
7. **`backdrop-blur`** — glass blur is not part of the DS surface language.
8. **`bg-[rgba(...)]` scrims** — hand-rolled overlay tints. Use the single
   `bg-ih-backdrop` overlay token instead.
9. **`text-white` on a `bg-ih-primary` fill** — it bypasses the theme flip. Dark
   mode brightens `--ih-primary` and flips `--ih-fg-inverse` to a dark value
   (≈5.8:1); white against the brightened primary is ≈2.9:1 and fails AA. 95
   sites had hand-written white before this became a rule. Use
   `text-ih-fg-inverse`.

### Escape hatches

- **`ds-allow` comment** — on the offending line, or anywhere in the 10 lines
  above it — excuses the violation. Always state the reason (fixed-dark
  surfaces, print output, email bodies rendered in external clients).
- **`print:`-variant utilities are ignored** — print output is intentionally
  fixed-color.
- **File allowlist** — a short, justified list in `FILE_ALLOWLIST` inside the
  script. Every entry today is either the email-template preview (email bodies
  render in external clients with no dark mode and no CSS variables) or one of
  the Photo/Media Studio chrome components, which are intentionally fixed-dark
  regardless of theme. Keep this list short; prefer a `ds-allow` comment for
  anything narrower than a whole file.

### Where it runs

- `npm run lint` — one of every gate in `scripts/lib/gate-registry.mjs`. That
  registry is the list; among the ones worth knowing beside this gate are
  `lint:contrast` (the arithmetic this one cannot do) and `lint:deadcode`
  (knip, which flags unused exports so retired primitives don't linger in
  `shared-ui`).
- Pre-commit (`.githooks/pre-commit`) — it is at the `precommit` rung, so it
  runs on **every** commit, docs-only ones included. Only the type-check tier is
  skipped when nothing TypeScript is staged.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `lint-gates` job) via `npm run lint:gates-full`.

## 6. Contributing checklist

Before opening a PR that touches UI:

- [ ] **Tokens only** — no raw Tailwind palette classes, `bg-white`/`bg-black`,
      or `shadow-sm/md/lg/xl/2xl`. Run `npm run lint:ds` locally.
- [ ] **Dark mode checked** — toggle `data-color-scheme="dark"` on `<html>`
      (or use the in-app theme switcher) and confirm the surface still reads
      correctly. Token-only components get this for free; anything with a
      hardcoded color won't.
- [ ] **Reuse primitives** — check `packages/shared-ui/src/index.ts` before
      writing a new button/card/modal/pill. If you're duplicating a pattern a
      third time, promote it into `shared-ui` instead of copy-pasting again.
- [ ] **Interaction pattern matches the rules above** — a single auto-saving
      field is inline; anything with cross-field validation, side effects, or
      an unsaved state is a form (page-level or `Modal`).
- [ ] **No native dialogs** — `window.confirm`/`alert`/`prompt` are banned;
      use `Modal`.
- [ ] `npm run lint:ds` and `npm run lint` pass.
