/**
 * The account-export classification for the `users` row.
 *
 * `exportAccount` (server/services/account.service.ts) is the GDPR/CCPA
 * self-serve data export behind `POST /api/identities/account/export`. It used
 * to open with a star select on `users` and hand the whole row back, so the
 * download carried the caller's password hash, their TOTP seed and their TOTP
 * recovery-code hashes. It is the caller's own data, so it was never a
 * cross-user leak — but a TOTP seed is a LIVE second factor: anyone who ends up
 * holding the blob can mint valid codes indefinitely, and export blobs travel
 * (Downloads folders, cloud sync, support tickets, forwarded email).
 *
 * ── WHY A CLASSIFICATION AND NOT A DENYLIST OR AN ALLOWLIST ─────────────────
 *
 * Deleting three fields at the call site would fix today and reopen tomorrow.
 * The two obvious shapes each fail in one direction, and the directions are not
 * symmetrical in cost but they are both real:
 *
 *   DENYLIST (drop these three, ship the rest) — complete by default, which is
 *   exactly what a data-portability export wants: a personal-data column added
 *   next month is exported without anybody remembering to. But a SECRET column
 *   added next month is exported too, silently, and the failure is not
 *   recoverable — a credential that has left cannot be un-sent.
 *
 *   ALLOWLIST (ship only these, drop the rest) — safe against a new secret
 *   column, and wrong in the other direction: a new personal-data column
 *   silently vanishes from the export, which under-discloses on a
 *   subject-access request. That failure is quiet, and the export looks healthy
 *   the whole time it is incomplete.
 *
 * So neither default is taken. Every column of `users` is CLASSIFIED here as
 * `export` or `withhold`, each with a reason, and a new column that is neither
 * is a hard test failure — the same resolution `erasure-manifest.ts` reached
 * for the same shape (every PII-heuristic column is a rule or an explicit
 * out-of-scope entry with a reason, and a gate refuses anything else).
 * `tests/unit/privacy/account-export-classification.spec.ts` is the enforcement
 * and states why it is a test rather than a `scripts/check-*.mjs` gate.
 *
 * The runtime default for an unclassified column is WITHHOLD, and that choice
 * only ever applies in the window between a column being added and the test
 * being run. It is the recoverable failure of the two, and it is not silent:
 * an unclassified column is reported in the export bundle's own `identityWithheld`
 * list, so a subject reading an under-disclosing export can see that something
 * was held back and ask why. A vanished column with no trace is the thing the
 * allowlist critique above is about, and this is what stops it.
 *
 * ⚠️ A reason here is prose and prose is not evidence — the erasure manifest
 * carries the same warning after two of its justifications were checked against
 * the code and found false. Before relying on one of these lines, go read what
 * writes the column.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT ABOUT, asked and answered ─────────────────────────
 *
 * Its scope is the columns of the `users` row, and nothing else. `exportAccount`
 * hands back that record plus the agent-tenant links; it carries no INSPECTION
 * content of any kind — not a report, not a finding, and not a courtesy
 * translation of one (`report_translations`).
 *
 * That was checked rather than assumed, because the obvious worry is real in
 * shape: an export that returned the English report while withholding the
 * translation the subject was actually sent would be answering a different
 * question than the one asked. There is no such asymmetry here, because neither
 * half is in this export. A subject-access request that reaches report content
 * does not travel through this module, and adding a table row to a
 * column-classification catalogue would make the catalogue mean two things.
 * Recorded so the next reader does not have to re-derive it.
 */

/**
 * What the export does with one column of `users`.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT exported: nothing outside this module needs to name it, and
 * the dead-code gate flags an exported type with no external reader — a public
 * symbol nobody imports is surface to keep in sync for no reason. Reach it as
 * `AccountExportFieldRule['disposition']` if that ever changes.
 */
type AccountExportDisposition = 'export' | 'withhold';

/**
 * One column of `users`, classified.
 *
 * `field` is the DRIZZLE PROPERTY name, because that is the key the selected
 * row (and therefore the exported JSON) actually carries. `column` is the
 * snake_case DB name, because that is the vocabulary a DSAR audit and the
 * erasure register speak. Both are recorded and the spec asserts they match the
 * live table, so a column rename cannot leave this file describing a shape that
 * no longer exists.
