/**
 * Unread-field census — fields the PRODUCT declares, fills, and never reads.
 *
 * ## The blind spot this closes
 *
 * `lint:unwired` asks whether the running product can reach a MODULE. It is a
 * good question and it is answered at file granularity, which means it could
 * never have caught the defect that prompted this gate.
 *
 * `EmbedData.siteKey` was declared on an interface, populated by the embed
 * loader from `resolveTurnstileSiteKey`, handed to the component that renders
 * the embedded booking form — and read by nobody. The form posted
 * `turnstileToken: fd.get("cf-turnstile-response")`, always null, because no
 * widget had ever written that input. Meanwhile `admitBooking` refused every
 * tokenless booking on saas. The embedded booking form took no bookings at all,
 * and the file holding the dead field is a route the product renders every time
 * someone opens it — perfectly reachable, and therefore invisible to `unwired`.
 *
 * ## The question this asks
 *
 * For every property of every object type declared under `app/`, `server/` and
 * `packages/`: does any NON-TEST source read it? A field nothing reads is
 * either debt or a defect, and this repo's ledger says the second often enough
 * to be worth a gate.
 *
 * "Non-test" is load-bearing and is the same choice `lint:unwired` makes. A
 * field kept alive only by its own spec is precisely the shape being hunted:
 * `TemplateSchema.schemaVersion` is declared in three separate type files and
 * every mention outside those declarations is in a `.test.` file.
 *
 * ## What this gate cannot do
 *
 * It matches on NAME, not on type. A dead `Foo.name` is masked by every other
 * `.name` in the tree, so this UNDER-REPORTS. That is deliberate: the exact
 * question ("who reads this symbol") needs a TypeScript program, and a
 * type-aware pass is the one thing this repo has measured as unaffordable
 * locally — it is why type-aware eslint does not run here. Under-reporting is
 * the safe direction for a census; over-reporting is what gets a gate switched
 * off.
 *
 * It also cannot tell a field kept for a caller that does not exist yet from
 * one nobody ever wired. Only the reason string distinguishes those, and a
 * person writes that. The gate checks a reason EXISTS; it cannot check it is
 * true.
 *
 * ⚠️ ITS LOUDEST FALSE POSITIVE IS THE OBJECT PASSED WHOLE. A field consumed by
 * `JSON.stringify(x)`, by `logger.info(msg, x)`, or by any call that takes the
 * containing object rather than the field is read by something this scan cannot
 * see — it is looking for `.field`, and nobody wrote one. Four entries were
 * classified `deferred` on that basis before anybody traced the callers:
 * `ParkedFingerprint.invalidFields` is stringified into the parked row,
 * and three cron summaries are handed to the structured logger whole, one of
 * them with a comment insisting all its numbers be reported every run.
 *
 * The lesson is about the REASONS, not the count. "No `.field` read" is a fact;
 * "the parking lot does not record what was invalid" is a story, and the story
 * was false. Trace the consumer before writing a reason down.
 *
 * ## How the instrument was checked, before its output was believed
 *
 * Against the tree with `EmbedData.siteKey` restored to its pre-fix state it
 * reported that field, at the right file and line. Against the fixed tree it
 * does not, and the total moves by exactly one. A census nobody has red/green
 * tested is a number, not a measurement.
 *
 * Five passes of precision work came out of that, each one measured rather than
 * guessed. 211 findings with a line-based body scan; 141 once the body is taken
 * by matching braces (the line-based one walked off the end of a type and
 * reported the following function's PARAMETERS as its fields); 103 once types
 * whose keys are enumerated are excused; 95 once `scripts/` counts as a place a
 * field can be read from.
 *
 * The last two went the OTHER WAY, and that is the more useful half. Excluding
 * prose took the count UP, 95 -> 98, because this file's own header had been
 * counting as a read of the fields it names as examples. Reading the working
 * tree rather than the index fixed a blindness to files not yet `git add`-ed —
 * caught when a component was written to consume a flagged field and the count
 * did not move. A census that only ever falls is not being corrected.
 *
