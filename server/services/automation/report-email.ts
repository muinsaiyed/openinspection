/**
 * Deliver a single `report.published` EMAIL log as a per-recipient tokenized

 * in server/api/inspections/publish.ts (issueToken -> buildPortalUrl ->
 * buildRenderReportUrl -> reportPdf.getOrRender -> streamPdf ->
 * sendInspectionReportPdf, with sendReportReady text fallback) but
 * per-recipient and cron-driven.
 *
 * The PDF is rendered ONCE per inspection: `pdfMemo` is a flush()-call-scoped
 * map the caller declares once before its loop and passes into every call for
 * the same batch, so an `all`-recipient rule with N logs for one inspection
 * triggers exactly one `getOrRender`.
 *
 * Never throws — always marks the log row itself (mirrors the existing
 * post-deliverAction bookkeeping in flush(): `status:'sent'` + `deliveredAt`
 * when the underlying send actually dispatched, `status:'skipped'` + `error`
 * when nothing was sent without an exception (report-ready template disabled
 * for the tenant, or email not configured — sendReportReady/sendInspectionReportPdf
 * return `false` in that case), `status:'failed'` + `error` on any thrown
 * exception), so the caller can simply `continue` after awaiting this.
 *
 * Simplification vs publish.ts: the cron path doesn't resolve a signature
 * inspector (that lookup lives in the request-scoped publish flow and isn't
 * worth threading through the batch cron path just for the footer signature)
 * — the report email still sends correctly without it, just without the
 * inspector signature footer.
 *
 * WHOSE WORDS GO OUT. The rule's `email_template_id` decides, exactly as it
 * does on the generic path (deliver-email.ts). This branch used to ignore it
 * and render the `report-ready` catalogue default for every rule, which broke
 * two things at once, both of them per-ROLE:
 *
 *  1. Copy. `report.published` carries five distinct seeds — Report Ready, the
 *     buyer's-agent and listing-agent variants, the post-inspection follow-up,
 *     the review request — each with its own subject and body, and each
 *     targeted at a different role. Rendering one catalogue template for all
 *     five delivered them as the same email. A client who is also the buyer's
 *     agent on an order therefore received the identical message twice, and the
 *     follow-up a day later was indistinguishable from the delivery it was
 *     following up on.
 *  2. The recipient's kill switch. `automationClassId` exists because those
 *     five seeds do NOT agree on whether they may be switched off (spec §5.3:
 *     report-ready is required, the follow-up and review request are not).
 *     Sending them all through `sendReportReady` stamped every one of them
 *     `report-ready` — a required class the preference gate fails closed on —
 *     so muting the follow-up had no effect on what arrived.
 *
 * A rule with no resolvable email template still falls back to the catalogue
 * default below: a stale template reference must not be the reason a published
 * report goes undelivered.
