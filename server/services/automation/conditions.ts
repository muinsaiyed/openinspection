/**
 * Conditions mixin: OI adapter over the core condition evaluator. Pre-resolves
 * the DB-derived facts (agreement-signed, booked service ids, reminder
 * staleness) into a ConditionContext, then delegates the decision to
 * automation-core. The DB reads stay LAZY (a read runs only when its gate is
 * actually requested), so the verdict and skip-reason are byte-identical to the
 * former monolith. One subtlety vs the old sequential body: facts are resolved
 * BEFORE the core decides, so a rule that sets multiple gates and skips on an
 * earlier one (e.g. requirePaid) may run a later gate's read-only scoped SELECT
 * that the old short-circuit would have skipped — a query-count delta on the
 * cron path only, never an outcome change.
