/**
 * Dead-code anti-drift gate — baseline-ratchet model over `knip`.
 *
 * Runs `knip` (config: `knip.json`) and compares its findings against a frozen
 * snapshot in `scripts/knip-baseline.json`. Any NEW finding not in the baseline
 * fails the gate (exit 1); pre-existing findings pass silently. Stale baseline
 * entries that no longer hit are informational only (run `--update` to prune).
 *
 * Why a wrapper (and not plain `knip`): knip 6 has no native baseline file, and
 * the tree once carried a large residual of dead exports/files/deps (leftovers
 * the T9 deletion pass did not reach). Freezing that residual let the gate go
 * green while catching every NEW piece of dead code — the same baseline-ratchet
 * used by `check-tenant-scoping` and `check-file-size`.
 *
 * The ratchet reached zero once and has NOT stayed there: the baseline now
 * holds two `files:` entries (the non-translatable legal manifests, which knip
 * cannot see are loaded by the i18n gate). Two is the number to argue down, not
 * a licence to add a third — a baseline that only ever grows has stopped being
 * a ratchet.
 *
 * This paragraph used to claim the file was `[]` and must stay `[]`, and it kept
 * saying so for two PRs after the entries went in. A gate's own description is
 * read as its rules; when it drifts it does not merely go out of date, it
 * misstates what is allowed. Whoever changes that file changes this line.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-deadcode.mjs            # gate (CI + `npm run lint`)
 *   node scripts/check-deadcode.mjs --update   # regenerate the baseline snapshot
 *
 * When a NEW finding is legitimate, the fix is to declare WHY in `knip.json`,
 * not to grow the baseline. The three shapes that come up:
 *   - a file that is a graph root (a worker/config/route entry) -> `entry`
 *   - an export a NON-TypeScript tool consumes (a gate script that reads the
 *     source as text, so the module graph cannot see it) -> tag the export
 *     `@gateConsumed` (wired via `tags: ["-gateConsumed"]`); this is per-export,
 *     so the rest of the file stays under the gate. Example:
 *     `ERASURE_OUT_OF_SCOPE`, read by `scripts/check-erasure-manifest.mjs`.
 *   - an export that exists so the TYPE can be NAMED in emitted `.d.ts`.
 *     tsconfig.api.json is a composite project: an unexported alias that shows
 *     up in an exported member's inferred type is TS4053/TS4055, so the alias
 *     has to be exported even though no module imports it by name. Tag it
 *     `@declarationEmit` (wired via `tags: ["-declarationEmit"]`). Example:
 *     `RepairListEntry` in inspection-analytics.service.ts.
 *   - a dependency knip cannot resolve -> `ignoreDependencies`
 * `--update` is a last resort and needs review of every entry it adds.
 *
 * console.* is intentional — this is a build script, not server code (the
 * no-console rule is server-only).
