/**
 * The order-wide gate's release control.
 *
 * Two things are being pinned. First, a reason cannot be skipped — the whole
 * value of the record is that somebody later reads why this happened, and an
 * override with no stated reason is indistinguishable from a mistake. Second,
 * once unlocked the component stops being an ACTION and becomes a RECORD: who
 * released it, when, and their words. A control that quietly forgot the reason
 * after the fact would satisfy the API and defeat the point.
