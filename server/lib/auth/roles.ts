 * The administrator tier: `owner` and `manager` administer the company;

 *
 * This predicate is the ONE definition. It was previously re-derived in seven
 * places — `role === 'owner' || role === 'manager'` inline in three API
 * modules, as a same-named local in `mcp/tag-catalog`, inline in `rbac/can-edit`
 * and two frontend files, plus a separate copy in `app/lib/access.ts` whose
 * comment described itself as "mirroring" this module. A mirror is a copy, and
 * copies drift.
 *
 * An EIGHTH copy surfaced later, in `api/availability.ts`, written as
 * `![ROLE.MANAGER, ROLE.OWNER].includes(userRole)` — four times. It survived the
 * consolidation above for a reason worth knowing: `c.get('userRole')` was `any`
 * at the time (a route middleware annotated with hono's bare `Context` collapsed
 * every handler's Env), so `Array<'owner'|'manager'>.includes(any)` type-checked
 * happily. The copy was invisible to a compiler that had stopped asking.
 *
 * Note this is DIFFERENT from `getCapabilities(...).manageContacts` and friends:
 * this is the coarse role tier, capabilities are the per-user overrides layered
 * on top. Gating something on "is an admin" when you mean "may manage contacts"
 * is how a per-user override gets silently ignored — reach for the capability
 * when one exists for what you are guarding.
