/**
 * A Home Inspector Pro template, converted to the v2 schema.
 *
 * ── What the file is ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A `.tpz` is a zip. The structure lives in one entry inside it, a
 * `java.beans.XMLDecoder` document, and everything else in the archive is
 * attachments this reader has no use for.
 *
 * ⚠️ READS, NEVER EXECUTES — see `../formats/java-xml-encoder.ts`. Nothing here
 * instantiates anything the document names.
 *
 * ── What twenty-two real templates taught this reader to refuse to assume ───
 * Re-measured against the corpus on 2026-08-24. Three of the five claims below
 * had numbers attached that did not survive; the numbers are now the measured
 * ones and the two that were simply wrong are marked. See
 * `tests/fixtures/intake/manifest.json`, which records each against a hash.
 *  · The rating vocabulary is USER-DEFINED — thirty-three distinct words across
 *    the corpus, and a bare majority of template pairs share not one of them.
 *    So the vocabulary is reported rather than interpreted, and reported
 *    verbatim: real entries carry leading and trailing spaces, and trimming
 *    them hides from the person classifying them exactly the thing he is
 *    classifying. ⚠️ Every template declares exactly FIVE entries, not the
 *    "three, four and five" this comment used to claim, and NONE of the
 *    twenty-two is without one — so the fallback below is a path no real file
 *    has ever taken. Keep it; do not mistake its green tests for evidence.
 *  · `showRatings` is ABSENT more often than present — thirteen against nine.
 *    Absent is null here, not false, because false is a statement the file did
 *    not make. ⚠️ Two things follow that this comment used to miss: where the
 *    flag IS present it is false in every case and true in none, so nothing
 *    downstream of "ratings shown" has been driven by a real file; and one more
 *    template supplies it as an object REFERENCE, which this reader reports as
 *    absent because resolving it would mean executing the graph. Three states,
 *    not two.
 *  · ⚠️ NOT twenty-one of twenty-two carrying no version. There are two things
 *    here that can be called a version: the attribute the document opens with,
 *    carried by all twenty-two and spanning about fifteen years, and a property
 *    inside the graph, absent on nine. Nothing branches on either — which is
 *    exactly how a number nobody read stayed wrong.
 *  · Archives held between three and fifty-four entries, so NOTHING is required
 *    to be present except the structure file.
 *  · One of the twenty-two is EMPTY. An empty template converts to an empty
 *    template; it does not refuse the upload. It still carries a full
 *    vocabulary, so empty template does not mean empty document.
 *
 * ── Purity ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Ids are derived from position, never minted, so the same bytes convert to the
 * same bundle and a re-map can be compared against what was staged.
