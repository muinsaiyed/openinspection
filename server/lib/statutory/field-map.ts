/**
 * The map from our fields onto ONE revision of an authority's PDF — and the
 * rule that it is never inherited by the next revision.
 *
 * ── Why this cannot be generated ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Official forms arrive in three shapes and none of them is self-describing:
 *
 *   1. A fillable form whose field names carry meaning (`Owner Name`). Rare, and
 *      the examples measured were the withdrawn revisions.
 *   2. A fillable form whose field names carry none — runs of `Text1`…`Text66`
 *      with a number missing from the middle, bare digits, and generated
 *      subform paths. Nothing in the file says which of them is the client's
 *      name, and nothing groups the four boxes of a four-way rating: that
 *      grouping is visual only.
 *   3. A form with no fillable anything: no `/AcroForm`, no widgets, no
 *      annotations. A word processor document printed to PDF. Every value on
 *      one of these has to be drawn at a measured coordinate.
 *
 * Shape 2 is the dangerous one, not shape 3. Shape 3 fails immediately and
 * visibly. Shape 2 fills the wrong box, quietly, on a document somebody files
 * with a government agency.
 *
 * ── The hash is the mechanism, not the paperwork ────────────────────────────
 * Field names in these files are typed by hand by whoever produced them, and one
 * real form carries a misspelled name. A later revision that corrects the
 * spelling does not break a map inherited from the earlier revision — it moves
 * content into a different box and raises NOTHING. So a map names the sha256 of
 * the exact bytes it was authored against, every check compares against that
 * hash, and a map can never silently follow a form to its next revision.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT `checkedBy` / `checkedAt` PROVE, AND WHAT THEY DO NOT. They record
 * that a person put their name to this map on a date. Nothing in this file, and
 * nothing in the gate that reads it, can establish that they opened the form and
 * looked at it. That limit cannot be closed in code; it is stated here so a
 * green check is not read as more than it is.

/**
 * One answer, as it arrives from the inspection.
 *
 * A STRING is one answer: text for a blank, or the one option a single-choice
 * question chose. An ARRAY is several options of ONE question — the shape a
 * form's multi-select boxes actually take, and the reason it exists: counted on
 * the three forms measured, `photo_requirements_included` prints 6 boxes,
 * `electrical.hazards_present` 13, `electrical.wiring_types` 8,
 * `plumbing.pipe_types` 8, `roof[*].damage_signs` 8 and the 1802's
 * `roof_covering_types` 7, and every one of them is plainly multi-select on the
 * page. A single string could ever mark one of them.
 *
 * ⚠️ AN EMPTY ARRAY IS REFUSED, and this is a decision rather than an oversight.
 * "None of these boxes" already has a spelling here — the empty string, which
 * every layer treats as an explicit answer of nothing — and one answer with two
 * spellings is a permanent question at every read site about which one a given
 * producer emits. An empty array is also exactly what a collector that resolved
 * nothing produces, and on a statutory form a question with no box ticked reads
 * identically to a question nobody was asked.

/**
 * One value's route onto the page.
 *
 * `acroform` — set a named form field. Only possible where the form has fields.
 * `overlay`  — draw the text at a measured coordinate. The only route for a
 *              form with no fields, and it has nothing that can tell you at
 *              runtime that the coordinate is wrong, which is why overlay
 *              coordinates need a regression test rather than a review.
 *              `maxHeight` and `minSize` are what stop a long answer running
 *              down over the row beneath it: the room measured below the
 *              baseline, and how small the text may shrink before the value is
 *              refused instead. Both are optional and a map that declares
 *              neither behaves exactly as it did before they existed — most
 *              rows on these forms hold one line, so the pair is worth
 *              declaring wherever anyone has measured.
 * `checkbox` — draw a mark at a coordinate when our answer names `whenValue`.
 *              Several of these share one `ourField` on purpose: that is how a
 *              multiple-choice answer maps onto boxes the file does not group.
 *              A string answer names one of them; an array names every box it
 *              contains, which is what a multi-select question needs.
 *              ⚠️ It DRAWS. On a form whose boxes are real widgets that is the
 *              wrong route — see `acroform_checkbox` — because the printed page
 *              comes out right and the field data still reads unticked.
 * `acroform_checkbox` — SET a named `/Btn` widget when our answer names
 *              `whenValue`. The mirror of `acroform` for the other kind of
 *              field, and the only route that puts the answer in the DOCUMENT
 *              rather than only on the page. Measured on TX TREC REI 7-6: 245
 *              fields, 81 text and 164 genuine checkbox widgets. Nothing is
 *              drawn, so the page's own content stream is untouched, and a
 *              widget the answer did not choose is left exactly as published
 *              rather than actively cleared.
 * `signature` — draw a stored signature image inside a measured box. `scope`
 *              names WHICH PART of the form this signature stands behind: the
 *              Citizens four-point form lets a trade-specific licensee sign only
 *              their own section, so one form can carry several signatures that
 *              each answer for a different part, and a single form-wide role
 *              cannot say that. Use `whole_form` when the form has one signer.
