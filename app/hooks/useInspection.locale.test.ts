/**
 * IA-92 — the editor header's date used `toLocaleDateString(undefined, …)`,
 * i.e. the RUNTIME's default locale. That is en-US on the Workers server and
 * whatever the visitor set in their browser on the client, so the same date
 * rendered as two different strings and React threw #418 on every editor load
 * outside en-US. (The German case below stands in for that: a locale whose
 * date format genuinely differs from the server's.)
 *
 * The guard against a regression is mostly structural — `locale` is a REQUIRED
 * option now, so it cannot be omitted back into a runtime default. This pins
 * the other half: that the value passed in is actually the one used, rather
 * than being accepted and then ignored.
