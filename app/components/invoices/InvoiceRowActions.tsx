/**
 * The Action column of the invoices table — every verb one invoice offers.
 *
 * It is a component rather than an inline cell because it holds a small state
 * machine of its own: the row is either showing its verbs or showing the
 * payment-method picker, and which verbs exist depends on whether the invoice
 * is paid and whether it has an inspection behind it. The page owns the state
 * (one picker open at a time across the table); this owns what each branch
 * renders.
 *
 * IA-122/IA-123 are the reason the branches look the way they do:
 * - "View inspection" appears on EVERY row that has one, paid or not.
 *   Previously only paid rows got a button, so the invoice actually needing
 *   chasing was the one you could not click through from. It is one control
 *   for one destination — the client's name is not a link, because a name
 *   reads as a name and announced as "View inspection" to a screen reader.
 * - "Payments" appears on every row including paid ones. "Mark paid" answers
 *   "is it settled?"; this answers the question a dispute turns on — which
 *   payments arrived, when, by what means, and who wrote them down.
 * - "Void" exists at all because a standalone invoice used to end its life as
 *   a bare "—": nothing to open, nothing to correct. DELETE /api/invoices/{id}
 *   voids rather than deletes and the row survives for the audit trail, so the
 *   verb is "Void" and the confirm copy says the same.
