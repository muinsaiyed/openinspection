/**
 * One revision, and the upload that supplies its PDF.
 *
 * ── WHY A NATIVE FORM AND NOT A GUARDED FETCHER ─────────────────────────────
 * The same reason `StartImportPanel` gives, and it is worth repeating where the
 * next person will read it: this app's guarded submit carries a
 * `Record<string, string>`, and a `File` spread into one becomes nothing at
 * all — silently. The browser's own multipart encoding is the thing that knows
 * how to send a file, so the input stays a real form control inside a real
 * `<Form>`. Double submission is contained the way a native form contains it:
 * the button is disabled while this row's own request is in flight, and the
 * write itself is idempotent by construction (the server admits exactly one
 * sequence of bytes for this revision, so a second upload can only overwrite
 * them with themselves).
 *
 * ── WHY THE REFUSAL IS RENDERED VERBATIM ────────────────────────────────────
 * The server's refusal names this file's sha256, the one this revision records,
 * the fact that the revision is printed inside the document, and where the
 * authority publishes it. That paragraph IS the remedy. An operator standing in
 * a downloads folder with four files called `form.pdf` and a banner reading
 * "Upload failed" has been told to guess. So `serverError` is printed as it
 * arrived, and the local sentence below it is used only when the server wrote
 * nothing of its own. It arrives in English, because it is composed in server
 * code and is not in the message catalogue; an instruction a reader can act on
 * beats a translated sentence they cannot.
