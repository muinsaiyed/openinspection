/**
 * The inspection's own lifecycle — independent of report publishing. "Mark
 * fieldwork complete" is the only producer of `completed`; it is advisory and
 * never a publish precondition.
 *
 * The card used to render its heading, its status pill, and then — for a
 * completed or cancelled inspection — nothing at all, because the button is
 * hidden in those states and nothing took its place. A title and a badge over
 * blank space reads as broken rather than finished, so each terminal state says
 * what it means: completed means the visit happened, cancelled means it will not.
 *
 * AND SO DOES RECOVERY (#81), for the same reason and one more: this is where
 * the mis-click happens. Restoring is NOT an undo — the fee and the refund are
 * ledger entries that already happened — so the control says "Restore to
 * scheduled" and its confirmation names both halves. See RestoreInspectionAction.
 *
 * CANCELLING LIVES HERE (#67) because this card is the inspection's lifecycle,
 * and cancelling is the other end of the same axis "Mark fieldwork complete"
 * moves along — the one that says the visit will not happen. It is offered only
 * in the `actionable` state: the two terminal states are already the answer.
 *
 * No role gate on the control. `POST /:id/cancel` mounts
 * `requireRole('owner','manager','inspector')`, so an inspector standing at a
 * door nobody answered may cancel, and hiding the button from them would be
 * this page holding a second, stricter opinion than the endpoint that enforces
 * it.
