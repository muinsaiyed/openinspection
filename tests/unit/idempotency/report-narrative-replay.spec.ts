/**
 * Retry safety for `PATCH /api/inspections/{id}/reports/{reportId}/narrative`.
 *
 * The route replaces the inspector's report-level narrative wholesale, so it is
 * naturally idempotent — and that claim is worth asserting rather than writing
 * into a baseline as a sentence, because "naturally idempotent" is exactly what
 * an APPEND would also look like from the call site. The distinguishing test is
 * the last one here: two DIFFERENT texts under two keys must both land, which a
 * route that accumulated (or that replayed the wrong body) would fail.
 *
 * The narrative carries professional liability, which raises the cost of the
 * failure the guard prevents in the other direction too: a replayed save that
 * quietly kept an older draft would leave a report published with text the
 * inspector believes they replaced.
