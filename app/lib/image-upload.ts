 * the badge went to the server exactly as it came off disk, up to 2 MB. So the
 * one surface whose output is composited onto a published report was the one
 * with no way to fix a crooked scan or trim the paper around the mark.
 *
 * They share a cropper now. What is left here is the part that happens BEFORE
 * the cropper opens — deciding whether a file is acceptable, and whether it is
 * the kind of image a raster cropper should touch at all.
