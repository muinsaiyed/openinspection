/**
 * An incomplete destruction tells the controller, while there is still an
 * address to tell.
 *
 * The ordering is the whole problem. The cascade deletes `users`, so by the
 * time we know a store refused to purge there is nobody left to address. The
 * owner's email is therefore resolved in the same pre-cascade block as the KV
 * keys and the report ids — and then used, and then dropped.
 *
 * WHAT THE ROW KEEPS, and what it does not. Notification is owed without undue
 * delay after the failure is known. That does not require this
 * table to retain the address. `tenant_destruction_records` survives the tenant
 * by three years, and the retention manifest sets that period on the stated
 * ground that the row is non-personal — tenant id, slug and counts. Writing the
 * owner's email onto it would make the destruction record hold an identifier of
 * the very party it certifies we erased, and would falsify the reason the
 * three-year window rests on. So the row records THAT the controller was
 * notified and WHEN; who they were is answerable from the slug and the account
 * record on the portal side, which is where the customer relationship lives.
 *
 * The wording is mechanical on purpose. A failure to finish a deletion is not a
 * security incident, and dressing it as one would misinform the recipient about
 * what happened and what they need to do.
