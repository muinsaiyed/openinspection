/**
 * What a converted template actually looks like, for the preview step.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The import step prints four numbers and they always add up. They cannot tell
 * a good conversion from a useless one: a template whose seventy-six items all
 * became plain text boxes reports the same total, the same "ready" count and
 * the same zero problems as one that converted perfectly. This is the shape
 * that difference is visible in.
 *
 * ── It reports, it does not judge ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Which of these facts is worth a person's attention is decided on the screen
 * that shows them, in one place, where the wording and the criterion sit
 * together. Splitting the judgement across a service and a component is how a
 * banner and the list under it come to disagree about what is wrong.
 *
 * ── The item vocabulary is OURS, and deliberately not the schema's ──────────
 * `rated / choices / plain` are what the preview says happened, not the item
 * types they came from. The screen must never print our storage names — that
 * is the rule the mapping step exists under — and a shape that carried
 * `textarea` to the browser would put the temptation one property away.
