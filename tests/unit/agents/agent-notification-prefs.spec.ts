/**
 * The agent's three notifications, gated where every notification is gated.
 *
 * This file used to assert that `sendNewReferral` read `agent.notifyOnReferral`
 * and returned early. That guarantee still holds — an agent who switches
 * referral mail off does not get referral mail — but it is no longer the send
 * METHOD's job, and pinning it there was pinning the wrong thing: three methods
 * each carried their own copy of the check, and the ~45 notifications with no
 * column simply had no off switch at all.
 *
 * So the assertions below sit on the far side of the boundary: a real row in
 * `notification_preferences`, the real port, and what actually reached the
 * PROVIDER. That also covers the part the old flags could not express — the
 * class id the boundary gates on is derived from the same trigger that rendered
 * the body, so a method cannot render one notification and be gated as another.
