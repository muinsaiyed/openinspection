/**
 * What a public-page visitor pays for the timezone table (#99).
 *
 * ── Why this is a harness and not a gate ──
 * It asserts only that its own instrument works. There are no ms thresholds: a
 * wall-clock budget on a shared box is a coin flip, and a flaky perf gate gets
 * disabled, which is worse than not having one. What it produces is a table of
 * numbers, printed, for a human to decide against.
 *
 * ── What is actually being paid, and by whom ──
 * `app/lib/timezones.ts` builds `TIMEZONE_SELECT_OPTIONS` at MODULE SCOPE.
 * `verify.tsx` imports `ViewerTimeZoneNotice` statically, so the module sits in
 * that route's client chunk graph and is evaluated during hydration by EVERY
 * visitor — including one whose envelope id is bogus, where the notice never
 * renders at all (verify.tsx returns early on `!result`, and the notice is
 * additionally behind `signers.some(s => s.signedAt)`).
 *
 * Two separate costs, with different populations:
 *
 *   A. module evaluation       — paid by everyone who loads the page
 *   B. 419 <option> DOM nodes  — paid only when the notice really renders
 *
 * A is the one worth measuring first, and it needs no seeded data.
 *
 * ── The confound this harness exists to resolve ──
 * The shipping implementation computes each zone's offset TWICE: once in the
 * `.map` feeding the sort, then again inside `timeZoneLabel` (the sorted offset
 * is destructured away). That is 2×419 `Intl.DateTimeFormat` + `formatToParts`
 * constructions where 419 would do.
 *
 * It does NOT follow that de-duplicating halves the cost. ICU timezone data is
 * initialised lazily and cached per process, so a second call for a zone can be
 * far cheaper than the first — the same effect measured on the server, where
 * ~15ms of a ~48ms module init was one-time ICU setup no code change removes.
 * The `two` vs `one` pair measures the real saving instead of assuming it, and
 * the ICU columns say whether the numbers are cold or warm.
 *
 * ── Throttling ──
 * `Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate` is what Lighthouse's mobile preset uses. It
 * scales main-thread execution and models nothing else — no memory pressure, no
 * weaker GPU, no thermal behaviour. For this question that is acceptable,
 * because the work IS main-thread JS plus DOM construction. It is still not a
 * real device: read 6× as "a slow phone's main thread", not as a Galaxy A15.
 *
 * Run: TZ_PERF=1 npx playwright test --project=timezone-perf
