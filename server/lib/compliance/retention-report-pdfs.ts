/**
 * One of the two retention executors that reach outside D1.
 *
 * Every other rule is a `db.delete(...)` against one store and lives in
 * `retention-executors.ts`. This one is here because it is a different KIND of
 * operation, not because the other file was long: the row points at an R2
 * object, so two stores have to agree, and the order they are touched in is a
 * correctness property rather than a detail. The intake rule
 * (`retention-migration-batches.ts`) is here for the same reason.
 *
 * It is also the only rule whose window is per-tenant, which is why it takes
 * `now` from the context and computes its own cutoffs instead of using the one
 * the sweep precomputed from the manifest.

/**
 * The one executor that touches R2.
 *
 * Order is not an implementation detail: the OBJECT goes first, then the
 * row. Reversed, a failure between the two leaves an object no row points
 * at — unreachable by this sweep, by the tenant purge, and by any future
 * cleanup, because the key lived only on the row. This way a failure leaves
 * a row whose object is already gone, which the next sweep retries
 * harmlessly (deleting an absent R2 key is a no-op).
 *
 * The per-tenant window is resolved per tenant rather than per row: one
 * config read per distinct tenant, not one per PDF.
