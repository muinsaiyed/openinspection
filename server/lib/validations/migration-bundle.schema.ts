/**
 * Runtime validation for MigrationBundleV1.
 *
 * Three rules are enforced here rather than left to adapter discipline,
 * because each of them replaces a failure that has been observed to pass
 * unnoticed:
 *
 *  1. No bundle may carry an id. Ids are minted on write.
 *  2. Per entity kind, `readFromSource === emitted + dropped.length`, and
 *     `emitted` equals the length of the array it counts. An entry that was
 *     lost has to be written down before the bundle validates.
 *  3. Every dropped entry is located and explained, never merely counted.

 * answered "that file is not a valid migration bundle" and named neither the

 * a mapping aimed at the wrong column — a mistake this refusal could not
 * describe and the mapping step could not be reached to correct.
 *
 * The permissiveness is bounded by exactly one rule: a value may be admitted
 * here only if the describer has a sentence for it. It has sentences for a
 * missing name, an address that is not one, a contact type outside our
 * vocabulary, a role outside the ones an import may grant, and the `agent` role
 * specifically. It has none for a wrong TYPE — a name that arrives as a number
 * cannot be explained to anybody — so the shapes stay.
