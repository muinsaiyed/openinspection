/**
 * Every agent-reachable endpoint must carry an explicit answer to one question,
 * and the answer must be written down where a reader can find it.
 *
 * The question is the one the gate's own doc comment already states: *does using
 * this require the agent to be bound by the Agent Terms?* The gate is mounted on
 * `*` and keyed on the actor, so a route added next year is behind it by
 * default. That default is the right one — it fails safe — but it also means the
 * decision NOT to gate something is invisible: it looks exactly like a route
 * nobody has thought about yet.
 *
 * ── Why this is a test and not a review checklist ───────────────────────────
 * The exemption list is short, exact, and hand-kept, and a hand-kept list has
 * one failure mode: the route that was never added to it. Prose in a doc comment
 * did not stop that — the tree already carries endpoints that were never
 * classified either way. So the universe is DERIVED here, from the routers the
 * application actually mounts, and compared against the table. A path in the
 * first set and not the second is a build failure, not a default.
 *
 * ── The universe, and why it stops where it does ────────────────────────────
 * `app.routes` is read from the real application, so this cannot drift from what
 * is served. It is narrowed to the three mounts an agent session reaches with
 * its own cookie. Anything under `/api/public` is deliberately NOT here and is
 * NOT "exempt" either: the JWT middleware short-circuits those paths before it
 * classifies anybody, `agentUserId` is never set, and the gate returns on its
 * first line. That is a third answer — outside the reckoning — and
 * `server/api/unsubscribe.ts` says in its own header that it must never be
 * moved into the exempt list. An exemption is a decision and decisions get
 * argued away; being structurally out of reach cannot be.
