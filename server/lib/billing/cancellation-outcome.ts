/**
 * What a cancellation costs, and what goes back.
 *
 * Pure — no DB, no clock, no side effects. This is the piece a tenant will
 * dispute, so it has to read as a table of cases, and it has to be testable
 * without a database in the room. Nothing here executes a refund: it computes
 * an outcome and the ledger records it.
 *
 * ON EPOCH ARITHMETIC AND TIMEZONES. The notice threshold is in HOURS between
 * two instants, and for that, subtracting epoch milliseconds is exactly right —
 * an hour is an hour across a DST boundary, and no timezone enters the
 * calculation. The timezone hazard is precisely why CALENDAR days are not
 * shipped: "2 business days", the other phrasing every published policy uses,
 * needs the tenant's zone, a weekend rule and a holiday list. Two of those
 * exist here and one does not, so v1 is hours only.
 *
 * ON THE FEE BASE. A percentage fee is of the inspection PRICE, but only what
 * was actually COLLECTED can be kept. Those are different numbers whenever a
 * deposit is involved, and conflating them invents a receivable nobody agreed
 * to: a 100% no-show fee against a 20% deposit must charge the deposit, not
 * bill the client for the other 80%.
