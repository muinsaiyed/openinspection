/**
 * The acceptance an INVITED member owes, resolved from the tenant's own
 * published documents.
 *
 * `joinTeam` is the engine-native door - nobody else captured this acceptance -
 * so unlike the portal-originated path there is no block travelling with a
 * command. The documents are whatever the TENANT currently has in force, which
 * is what the person is actually shown, and the versions and hashes come from
 * `tenant_legal_versions` rather than being composed here: a hash this module
 * invented would point at text nobody can produce.
 *
 * Like `buildAcceptanceStatement`, this returns STATEMENTS and executes
 * nothing. The acceptance rows go into the same
 * `db.batch()` as the `users` row, because an acceptance that lands afterwards
 * leaves the state `account = EXISTS, acceptance_ledger = ABSENT` in between,
 * however briefly and whatever the intent.

 *
 * Throws when the tenant has published no current version of a required
 * document. That refusal is deliberate and it is visible to the person trying
 * to accept the invite, which is the point: the alternative is an account whose
 * acceptance ledger is empty, and an empty ledger is indistinguishable from one
 * nobody ever wrote to.
 *
 * `statements` is EMPTY only in the one case where empty is honest - a
 * reactivated member whose acceptance of these exact versions is already on
 * record. The unique index is `(user, doc, version)` precisely so a second row
 * cannot read as the person having accepted twice, so re-recording would either
 * fail the join or forge a second event.
 *
 * `acceptance` is NOT the same list. It describes what this member has accepted
 * once the batch lands - every required document, each carrying the timestamp
 * ACTUALLY on record for it, which for a skipped document is the original
 * acceptance and not this attempt. A block reporting today's date for a
 * document accepted last year would be the plumbing overwriting the legal fact,
 * which is what `accepted_at` exists separately from `created_at` to prevent.
