/**
 * #81 — the hub's cancelled state has a way out, and it does not lie about money.
 *
 * The gap this closes: cancelling happens HERE, on the Lifecycle card, behind a
 * priced confirmation. Recovery lived on the `/inspections` list row's
 * hover-only status dropdown, a page away, with nothing on the cancelled card
 * pointing at it — so the one surface that takes the mis-click was the one
 * surface with no way to undo it.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED:
 *
 *   1. THE CONTROL EXISTS IN THE CANCELLED STATE — and only there. A Restore
 *      button on a scheduled inspection reads as a claim that something went
 *      wrong with it (the positive control below).
 *   2. THE CONFIRMATION NAMES BOTH HALVES. Un-cancelling is NOT an undo: the
 *      inspection returns to scheduled, and the fee kept plus the refund
 *      issued are ledger entries that already happened. Copy promising a clean
 *      reversal would be the comfortable sentence and the false one, so the
 *      assertion is on the money half specifically — that is the half a
 *      well-meaning rewrite drops.
 *   3. NOTHING IS WRITTEN UNTIL THE CONFIRMATION IS ACCEPTED, and the write
 *      goes to the BFF resource route. A client `fetch('/api/...')` here would
 *      arrive unauthenticated.
