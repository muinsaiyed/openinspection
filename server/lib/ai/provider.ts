 * AiProvider — the single contract every AI backend adapter satisfies.
 *
 * Modelled on `server/lib/email/provider.ts`. The interface is intentionally
 * minimal and, most importantly, carries NO backend-specific concept: no
 * "candidates", no "parts", no model-family naming, no vendor-shaped request
 * envelope. That neutrality is the entire reason the interface exists — the
 * moment one vendor's payload shape leaks into it, adding a second backend
 * means rewriting every caller instead of adding one file under `providers/`.
 *
 * Note what is NOT here: credentials. A provider is constructed with the creds
 * it needs; WHERE those creds came from (the tenant's own key, or a platform
 * key) is a separate decision owned by `resolve-provider.ts`. Managed access is
 * a credential SOURCE, not a second implementation.
