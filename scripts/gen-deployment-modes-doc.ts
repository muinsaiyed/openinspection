/**
 * Generates the capability table in `docs/reference/deployment-modes.md` from
 * the two profile constants, so the doc cannot drift from the code.
 *
 *   npm run docs:modes        # rewrite the table in place
 *
 * The drift gate is `tests/unit/platform/deployment-modes-doc.spec.ts`, which
 * imports `renderModesTable` from here and compares it against what is checked
 * in. A capability added to `DeploymentProfile` with no entry in `DESCRIPTIONS`
 * fails that spec — you cannot ship a mode-dependent behaviour that the
 * self-hosting docs never mention.
 *
 * Why a generator and not a hand-written table: the previous hand-written
 * version of this content said the field form lived at a route that had been
 * deleted, and named an "Admin" role that does not exist. Prose about an enum
 * rots at exactly the rate nobody is checking it.
