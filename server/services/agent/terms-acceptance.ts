/**
 * Whether a signed-in agent has accepted the agent terms in force, and how one
 * accepts them after the account already exists.
 *
 * Signup answers the same question at the moment an account is born
 * (`server/services/agent/signup.ts` refuses to insert a `users` row without an
 * acceptance). This module answers it for every request afterwards, because
 * signup is only one of the three doors into an agent session: password login
 * and the emailed magic link both mint a 24-hour cookie for an account that
 * already exists, and neither of them passes through a signup screen. An account
 * created before this rule existed reaches the product through those two doors
 * with no acceptance at all, which is the hole this closes.
 *
 * ── Where the acceptance lives: a ledger, and a projection of it ────────────
 * `agent_terms_acceptances` is the evidence of record — append-only, one row per
 * acceptance, tenant-less for the same reason `deployment_legal_versions` is.
 * (The general ledger next door, `account_acceptances`, cannot hold these: its
 * `tenant_id` is NOT NULL and an agent is global, so a row there would need a
 * tenant id invented for the occasion — a guess that later reads as a fact.)
 *
 * `users.terms_accepted` — the same JSON blob signup writes — stays, demoted to
 * a PROJECTION of the newest row. It is what the request-path gate reads, and a
 * gate that runs on every agent request should not run a join. It holds ONE
 * acceptance by construction, which is fine for the question it answers ("is
 * this agent bound by the text in force") and was never enough for the other one
 * ("what did this agent accept, and when") — that one is `agentTermsHistory`.

 * unrelated facts indistinguishable to anyone who read the boolean:
 *
 *   NOT_IN_FORCE  this deployment has published no agent terms, so there is no
 *                 contract to be bound by and none applies to anyone
 *   ACCEPTED      there is a contract in force and this agent has accepted it

 * load-bearing decision in this file, and which is UNCHANGED. What changed is
 * only what they are CALLED: a caller can no longer write `if (status.satisfied)`
 * and, without noticing, treat "there is no contract" as "the contract is
 * signed". Those are the two sentences an operator, an auditor and a log reader
 * all need told apart, and a boolean tells them apart to nobody.
 *
 * The other two are refusals, and they are also not each other:
 *
 *   REQUIRED      a document IS in force and this agent is not bound by it.
 *                 `requirement` says which way — see below.
 *   UNREADABLE    the registry did not answer. Deliberately NOT folded into
 *                 NOT_IN_FORCE: "the registry says there is nothing" and "the
 *                 registry said nothing at all" are different observations, and

 * Does this agent hold an acceptance of the agent terms in force?
 *
 * ── Comparison is on the CONTENT HASH, not the version string ────────────────
 * The version is what a reader is shown; the hash is what they agreed to. The
 * publish path already refuses to change a published version's body, so in
 * practice the two move together — but the hash is the one that cannot be made
 * to lie, so it is the one compared.
 *
 * ── Staleness counts, and this is the decision ───────────────────────────────
 * A superseded acceptance fails, not just a missing one. Signup already refuses
 * a form whose rendered text is no longer in force, so the rule "an acceptance
 * must name the text in force" is already this deployment's position for new
 * accounts; applying it only to new accounts would leave the two paths
 * disagreeing about the same document, and would make the version and hash on
 * the record decorative — written at signup, read by nobody, describing whatever
 * the document happened to say that day.
 *
 * A superseded agent is GATED, not locked out and not signed out: their session
 * stays valid, the refusal names the page that fixes it, and one screen later
 * they are back where they were asking. Publishing is a rare, deliberate operator
 * act, and republishing identical words returns the existing version rather than
 * minting a new one, so a no-op publish gates nobody.
 *
 * ── Nothing published is NOT a refusal, and that is deliberate ───────────────
 * When the deployment has published no agent terms at all there is no text to
 * accept, and refusing would be refusing on behalf of a document that does not
 * exist — the mirror image of recording an acceptance of an absent one, which
 * signup already refuses to do. It is also not a loophole an operator can sit in:
 * `POST /api/agent-signup` is closed in that same state, so a deployment with no
 * published terms cannot gain an agent. The population this spares is the one
 * that would otherwise be locked out by an upgrade: agents who already exist on a
 * deployment that has never had an agent-terms document. Every such pass is
 * logged as operator-actionable, because it is a state to leave, not a state to
 * be in.
 *
 * A read that FAILS is a different fact and fails closed. "The registry says
 * there is nothing" and "the registry did not answer" are not the same
 * observation, and only the second one is an outage.
