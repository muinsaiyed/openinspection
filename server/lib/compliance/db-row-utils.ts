/**
 * Track I-a GDPR — driver/timestamp helpers shared by the compliance executors.
 *
 * `changeCount` and `toMs` existed as byte-identical private copies in
 * `erasure-orchestrator.ts` and `retention-sweep.ts`. They are one definition
 * now: the two modules must agree on what "this update changed N rows" and
 * "this column is at instant T" mean, because a row erased on a DSAR and later
 * swept past its window has to land in the same place either way.
 *
 * The year arithmetic is deliberately UTC-only. A retention window is a record
 * -keeping obligation measured in whole years, not a local-calendar event, and
 * `setUTCFullYear` is the one operation that cannot shift by a day when the
 * boundary lands on a DST change.
