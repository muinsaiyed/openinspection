/**
 * Settings → Statutory form PDFs.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS SCREEN EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A statutory form renders onto the issuing authority's own published PDF, and
 * that PDF is not carried in this repository. `POST /api/admin/statutory-forms/
 * {formId}/source` has always been able to receive it, and until now nothing in
 * `app/` called that endpoint — so the only way to supply the file was to
 * hand-craft a multipart request. Meanwhile the marketplace install refuses a
 * statutory package with a message naming that endpoint, which told an operator
 * precisely what they could not do from the product.
 *
 * ── WHY SETTINGS AND NOT LIBRARY ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `/library/*` is a workspace's own content — things it authors, installs and
 * edits. This is none of those: it is a DEPLOYMENT prerequisite, owner-only,
 * done once per revision and shared by every workspace in the deployment (the
 * bytes live under one `_platform/` key, deliberately not tenant-scoped). That
 * is the same shape as `/settings/imports`, which is also an owner supplying a
 * file the server verifies and refuses in its own words, and it sits in the
 * Compliance group beside the other things a deployment has to have right in
 * order to be allowed to produce a document at all.
 *
 * ── OWNER, NOT ADMIN ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The API guard is `requireRole('owner')`. Gating this page on the wider admin
 * tier would offer a manager a form whose every submission answers 403.
