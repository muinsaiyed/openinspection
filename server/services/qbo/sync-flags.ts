/**
 * The open rows a human has to look at, and the only code that writes them.
 *
 * `qbo_sync_errors` is not only an error log. It carries three different kinds
 * of thing under `error_code` — a push that failed, two figures that disagree,
 * and a document QuickBooks zeroed — because each is "something a person has to
 * decide about" and the table already had a tenant scope, a resolved flag and a
 * settings surface. Keeping the writers together is what makes the identity of
 * an open row (tenant, oi_type, oi_id, error_code) checkable in one place.
 *
 * Free functions over a drizzle handle rather than methods, following
 * `inbound-reconcile.ts`: the QBO service is a stack of mixins, and every
 * behaviour that needs no HTTP has been pulled out of it so the class stays the
 * part that talks to Intuit.
