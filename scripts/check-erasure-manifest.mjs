/**
 * Track I-a GDPR (spec §11) — erasure-manifest CI lint gate.
 *
 * Asserts the INTERNAL validity of the erasure manifest
 * (`server/lib/compliance/erasure-manifest.ts`) and HARD-FAILS when a PII
 * column appears anywhere in the Drizzle schema without either a covering
 * manifest rule or an explicit ERASURE_OUT_OF_SCOPE entry.
 *
 * ⚠️ READ `docs/compliance/erasure-heuristic-limits.md` BEFORE TRUSTING A GREEN
 * RUN. "PII column" here means a column matching PII_HEURISTIC below, and that
 * pattern is a list of shapes someone thought of — every column it was not told
 * about is invisible to this gate and reads as correct. The document names what
 * is structurally out of reach (free prose, addresses, anything whose
 * sensitivity is contextual rather than lexical) and carries a worked example
 * that is currently open. A limits document nobody finds next to the gate is
 * exactly the failure mode it describes, which is why this pointer is here.
 *
 * This guard is COMPLEMENTARY to:
 *   - tests/unit/privacy/erasure-manifest-coverage.spec.ts (manifest <->
 *     orchestrator binding drift) — that proves every rule is realized by the
 *     executor.
 *   - This lint proves every rule is well-formed AND that NO schema table
 *     grows an un-cataloged PII column unnoticed.
 *
 * History note (portal #88 / roadmap §7.5 item 2): this check originally
 * scanned only the manifest's OWN tables and exited 0 on findings — a probe
 * that looked conclusive while covering less than the thing it probed. Client
 * PII sat unlisted in invoices, concierge_confirm_tokens,
 * inspection_access_tokens, email_suppressions and inspections for months and
 * the gate could not see any of it. Every column is now in-manifest or
 * declared out of scope WITH a reason; silence is no longer evidence.
 *
 * Approach (robustness over cleverness): the manifest is TypeScript, so instead
 * of transpiling we parse the rule object literals out of the source text. Each
 * rule is a single-line `{ ... }` entry inside the `ERASURE_MANIFEST` array; we
 * extract the `key: 'value'` pairs with a tolerant regex. The set of fields the
 * manifest uses is small and stable, and the structural assertions don't depend
 * on formatting beyond "one rule per object literal".
 *
 * HARD failures (exit 1):
 *   - any rule missing a non-empty table / column / category / action
 *   - any action not in {delete,null,hash,retain,anonymize}
 *   - any anonymize/retain rule missing a legalBasis
 *   - any ERASURE_OUT_OF_SCOPE entry missing a non-empty reason
 *   - a PII-heuristic column found in ANY schema table that is neither covered
 *     by a manifest rule nor declared in ERASURE_OUT_OF_SCOPE
 *
 * WARNINGS (exit 0, console.warn):
 *   - a pending rule whose enforcementDeadline falls within LEAD_TIME_DAYS.
 *     The hard failure above only ever arrives the day AFTER the date, on
 *     whoever happens to be committing; this is the notice that lets somebody
 *     schedule the work instead of being interrupted by it. It must never
 *     become a failure — see LEAD_TIME_DAYS.
 *
 * EVERY run, green or red, prints how many rules are pending enforcement and
 * when the nearest one is due. A verdict with no numbers behind it cannot be
 * checked on the day it is green, and green is every day but one.
 *
 * The heuristic deliberately includes `recipient` (automation_logs.recipient
 * holds emails and E.164 numbers — renamed from recipient_email, which is how
 * it escaped the original pattern) and bare `ip`.
 *
 * `address` was added only AFTER the address family was ruled on, and the order
 * was the point. Widening the pattern first would have turned the gate red on
 * twelve columns at once and made twelve out-of-scope entries the cheapest way
 * back to green — converting an open question into a recorded decision nobody
 * would revisit. `docs/compliance/erasure-heuristic-limits.md` says the same
 * thing at more length, and names what this gate still cannot see: read it
 * before treating a green run as coverage. Whatever the next widening is, rule
 * on the columns first, then widen.
