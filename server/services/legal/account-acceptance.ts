/**
 * Build the acceptance rows that ride the SAME write as the account.
 *
 * ── Why this returns statements instead of writing them ─────────────────────
 * The original design enqueued the acceptance
 * atomically with the account insert and let the ledger become consistent
 * afterwards; that does NOT fail closed. The distinction it misses: an
 * outbox proves *acceptance evidence was durably captured*, but it cannot prove
 * *acceptance was recorded in the acceptance ledger before account creation* —
 * and while the event is unconsumed the state is `account = EXISTS,
 * acceptance_ledger = ABSENT`, which breaks the one-write invariant whatever
 * the envelope holds.
 *
 * So this function does not own a transaction and cannot start one. It hands back
 * statements for the caller to place in the `db.batch()` that also inserts the
 * `users` row — D1's only atomic primitive. If the account write rolls back, so
 * does the acceptance, because they are the same write. A version of this that
 * executed its own insert would be correct-looking and would reintroduce exactly
 * the window this design refuses.
 *
 * ── Fail closed, and fail HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every refusal below happens before any statement is produced, so a caller
 * cannot half-build a batch. An account with no acceptance is the state this
 * exists to make unreachable; an acceptance with no version or no content hash
 * is worse than none, because it points at nothing checkable while reading as
 * evidence.
