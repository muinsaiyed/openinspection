 * WHAT THIS IS EVIDENCE OF, precisely: a named staff user looked at the output
 * of one AI call, attached to one artifact, at one time. It is NOT a claim that
 * the output was correct, and it is not an absolution — review is necessary, not
 * sufficient. "The user clicked confirm, therefore the
 * platform is absolved" is not a position this product may take, which is why
 * the column is `reviewed_by` and the control says *review*, never *accept*.
 *
 * ⚠️ IDEMPOTENT BY THE INDEX, not by a check-then-insert. The same person
 * confirming the same output twice is not two facts, so a retried request must
 * land as a no-op. `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` against
 * `uq_ai_content_reviews_person_call` does that atomically; a read-then-write
 * would race two concurrent retries into two rows and the unique index would
 * then reject the second with a 500 instead of shrugging.
 *
 * That property is also why this route is registered as idempotent BY DESIGN
 * rather than carrying a replay spec: there is no state a retry could corrupt.
 *
 * ⚠️ A SECOND REVIEWER IS NOT A DUPLICATE. `reviewed_by` is part of the unique
 * key, so two people reviewing the same output produce two rows — which is
 * exactly the evidence a four-eyes policy would want, and collapsing them would
 * destroy it.
