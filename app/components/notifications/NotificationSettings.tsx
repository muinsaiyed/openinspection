/**
 * The whole notifications surface: consent, the grid, and every rule that ties
 * the two together.
 *
 * Staff, agent and client each had their own copy of this — the fetcher, the
 * saving/saved status, the toast, the save and bulk handlers, and the two
 * derived facts that matter most (`smsUnavailable`, and the locked column that
 * follows from it). Three copies of a rule is three chances for one surface to
 * quietly stop enforcing it, and the one at risk here is the one that keeps the
 * screen agreeing with the send gate.
 *
 * WHAT DIFFERS BETWEEN SURFACES IS ONLY HOW A CHANGE IS SUBMITTED — the intent
 * name each route action listens for, and the extra fields the agent needs to
 * name a company. Both are props. Everything else is the same product.
