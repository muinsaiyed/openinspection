/**
 * Every capability the server declares must be grantable through the API that
 * grants capabilities (#77).
 *
 * `viewCommunication` shipped declared, role-defaulted, enforced on the Outbox
 * route, returned by `/me` and by the team endpoint, and rendered as a checkbox
 * in both team drawers — while the invite and update request schemas listed only
 * the other four by hand. Zod strips unknown keys, so the box was tickable,
 * submitted, and silently discarded: the capability was unsettable by anyone.
 *
 * These assertions are written as PARSE results, not shape introspection,
 * because stripping is what actually harmed users. A schema that merely
 * *mentions* a key it then drops would still pass an introspection test.
