 * `?intent=…` — rather than one upload box that guesses afterwards.
 *

 * It is the only one that never runs an adapter, and the only one where
 * starting the run means a person on the support team opens the file, which is
 * why it carries a second agreement the others do not ask for.

 * both rules can be asserted without a DOM and stay translatable.
