/**
 * Secrets UI — runtime middleware to load encrypted integration secrets
 * from tenant_configs.secrets_enc and merge them into c.env.
 *
 * Precedence (A-8 secret-resolution matrix):
 *  - Platform-shared keys (default): Worker env wins; the tenant DB value is a
 *    fallback for self-hosted tenants configuring keys via the Settings UI.
 *  - TENANT_OWNED_KEYS (Stripe Connect): the tenant DB value WINS over env. These
 *    are strictly per-tenant — each inspector collects payments into THEIR OWN
 *    Stripe account, and the platform never registers as a payment entity. If a
 *    stray platform STRIPE_SECRET_KEY env were ever set on the core worker, the
 *    env-wins default would silently route EVERY tenant's homebuyer payments to
 *    the platform account; DB-wins prevents that money-misrouting.
 *
 * Performance: decryption happens once per request and only if the tenant
 * has a non-null secrets_enc value. The result is cached on the
 * request context so multiple accesses to c.env.RESEND_API_KEY etc.
 * don't re-decrypt.
