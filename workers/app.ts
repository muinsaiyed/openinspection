/**
 * Vulnerability-scanner probes, answered without rendering anything.
 *
 * These paths reach the catch-all below, and the catch-all is a full React
 * Router SSR render — the 404 page is a real page, with the root layout, the
 * i18n scope and the whole render pipeline behind it. Measured in production
 * over 15h: `GET /.env` cost 200ms of CPU, `/config/.env` 89ms, `/backend/.env`
 * 87ms, `/wordpress/` 172ms. One scanner walking a wordlist, each miss costing
 * roughly what a real page costs, on a worker whose CPU ceiling is 10ms per
 * invocation.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY PATTERN HERE MUST BE ONE NO APP ROUTE COULD EVER USE. A false
 * positive is a real page turned into a 404 with nothing to explain it, which is
 * far worse than the CPU this saves. So: no bare-word matching, no guessing at
 * "suspicious" — only file types this app never serves and tool paths that
 * belong to other stacks entirely. React Router owns everything else, including
 * genuine typos, which still get the real 404 page.
 *
 * ⚠️ This still costs a Worker INVOCATION — it is a cheap 404, not a free one.
 * The only free answer is a WAF / firewall rule at the edge, where the request
 * never reaches the worker at all. That is dashboard configuration rather than
 * code; this is the half that lives in the repo.
