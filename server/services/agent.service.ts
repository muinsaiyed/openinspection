/**
 * Agent accounts — signup, the same-email auto-link routine, referrals, and
 * profile.
 *
 * Agents are global users (users.tenant_id IS NULL, role='agent') that connect
 * to one or more tenants via rows in `agent_tenant_links`. An account is
 * entirely OPTIONAL: an agent reads a report through a per-inspection access
 * token that works with no login at all. The account exists only to give a
 * frequent collaborator one place to see work across inspectors.
 *
 * There is therefore ONE way in:
 *
 *   - Jane is added as a contact on an inspection and receives her link.
 *     If she wants a standing account she signs up at /agent-signup, or
 *     follows the prompt from the portal's login / register pages.
 *     -> users row (tenant_id NULL, role=agent)
 *     -> autoLinkSameEmail() finds every contacts row where email=Jane's and
 *        type='agent' and creates an active agent_tenant_links row for each.
 *
 * A parallel invite track used to exist (`agent_invites`, a 7-day token, an
 * accept page). It was removed: it required an inspector to invite someone who
 * could already read everything without being invited, and it was the only
 * path that could produce a link with no contact behind it. Its POST endpoint
 * had no caller in the UI at all.
 *
 * The implementation is split into domain modules under `server/services/agent/`
 * (signup / referral / profile); this class stays the public facade so
 * `services.agent.X(...)` call sites + tests remain unchanged.
