/**
 * Drift guard for the hand-maintained workers-runtime DDL.
 *
 * The cmd-consumer / cmd-fixtures workers specs create `tenant_configs` from a
 * literal CREATE TABLE string instead of replaying migrations. Every time the
 * Drizzle schema gains a column, the cmd-apply upsert binds it — and if the
 * hand-written DDL lacks that column the statement parks and `test:workers`
 * fails (this blocked #164). That failure surfaces only in a real workerd run,
 * which is slow and easy to skip locally.
 *
 * This fast unit test asserts the shared DDL covers every Drizzle column, so the
 * drift is caught the moment a column is added — see CLAUDE.md "Comment Rules":
 * a "must stay in sync" coupling is made executable instead of left as a comment.
 *
 * Extra columns in the DDL (e.g. the legacy `secrets` column) are fine; only
 * MISSING columns break the apply path, so we assert coverage, not equality.
