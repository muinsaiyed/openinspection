/**
 * The auth boundary between the protected branch and the public one.
 *
 * Protection here is structural rather than per-route: `auth-layout.tsx`'s
 * loader calls `requireToken`, and a parent loader runs before its children, so
 * every route nested under that layout in `app/routes.ts` is guarded by
 * membership of the branch. Routes outside it — public booking, report viewing,
 * signing — must stay reachable with no session at all.
 *
 * That makes the branch boundary the load-bearing fact, and nothing in the unit
 * suites can see it: they call loaders directly, so a route moved out of the
 * layout keeps passing its own spec while silently losing its guard. The portal
 * side lost exactly that way — pages were moved to SSR and the guard did not
 * follow, and no unit test noticed for months.
 *
 * Asserted on HTTP STATUS, not on where a browser ends up: a page that renders
 * to an anonymous visitor and then redirects from its own JS is
 * indistinguishable from a server guard once the browser has settled.
