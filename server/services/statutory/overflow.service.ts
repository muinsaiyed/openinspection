/**
 * The repeated-block instances an authority's form has no slot to print.
 *
 * -- WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE HOME --------------------------------------------
 * Slots the form prints are ordinary template items: the inspector fills them
 * in the normal editor and their values reach the form as bindings. An instance
 * past `capacity` has no item, because there is nothing on the page for an item
 * to correspond to -- so it cannot live in the inspection results, and it is
 * kept here per (tenant, inspection, form) instead.
 *
 * -- THE KEY SHAPE IS THE ONE THE BINDINGS USE -------------------------------
 * `electrical_panel[2].total_amps`. One vocabulary, two places: the same string
 * a declaration would have written had the page had a third box. Inventing a
 * second shape here would mean translating between them, and a translation is
 * somewhere for the two to drift.
 *
 * -- WHAT THIS TABLE HOLDS, AND WHAT IT NO LONGER HOLDS ----------------------
 * It was designed to hold "a form's answers". It does not: answers come from
 * the inspection's own items. What is left for it is exactly what the item
 * model cannot express, which is a narrower job than it was given and a better
 * argued one.
 *
 * -- NO PERSONAL DATA -------------------------------------------------------
 * The same declaration as the printed slots make: what lands here is amperage,
 * panel age, brand -- property facts. Client identity reaches a form through
 * `from: 'inspection'` bindings and never through this table.
