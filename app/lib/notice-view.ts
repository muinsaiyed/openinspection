/**
 * Recipient-facing Notice view logic (design §3.16). Pure — no React, no fetch.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT `communication-view.ts`. That file is written for
 * an operator: it maps every raw reason to an operator sentence and keeps the
 * unmapped value visible. Both are correct for their reader, and a single map
 * with an audience flag is the shape that drifts — so the customer-facing list
 * is enumerated here, separately and much shorter.
 *
 * Two editorial rules, both of which the tests pin:
 *
 * 1. Only reasons that are ABOUT the recipient and ACTIONABLE BY THEM get
 *    words. "The rule has no template", "SMS isn't set up", "the number is
 *    awaiting carrier approval" are OUR problems; a customer reading them
 *    learns nothing they can act on and opens a support ticket. Everything
 *    unrecognized becomes a flat "Not delivered" — no detail, no button.
 * 2. A remedy renders only where the path behind it exists. "Turn on texts"
 *    is a real endpoint everywhere. The email remedy opens a message composer,
 *    so it renders only where there IS one. (There is deliberately no
 *    self-service email change: portal access is keyed on the address, so
 *    letting the current link-holder repoint it is an account-takeover shape.)
