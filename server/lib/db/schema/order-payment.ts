/**
 * The payment ledger — append-only, one row per movement of money against an
 * ORDER. It records what was RECEIVED, never what is OWED: the total keeps
 * coming from the money-authority chain (`getEffectivePriceCents()`), and the
 * invoice's `paid_at` / `partial_paid_at` / `amount_paid_cents` become a
 * denormalized cache recomputed from these rows by a single writer.
 *
 * Append-only means no UPDATE and no DELETE — a correction is a new row, which
 * is what makes the ledger reconcilable. There is exactly ONE exception, and it
 * is not a correction: `invoice_id` is written once onto rows that predate the
 * invoice, at the moment the invoice is raised.
 *
 * See spec 2026-08-01 payment/deposit flow §3.
