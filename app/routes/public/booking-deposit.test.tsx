/**
 * What the client is told about the deposit, and when.
 *
 * Two rules, and both of them are about not surprising anyone:
 *
 *  1. The amount is stated BEFORE the client commits. A charge discovered
 *     after clicking Book is a chargeback and a review, so the services step
 *     and the confirm summary both quote it, and both say it comes off the
 *     total rather than on top.
 *  2. The payment step only exists AFTER the booking does, and only when the
 *     SERVER says money is owed. A workspace with no deposit configured sees
 *     no payment step at all — the client-side quote can never conjure one,
 *     because the figure the panel charges is the one the server froze.
