/**
 * Verification-copy policy gate.
 *
 * A verification surface may state what the system actually checked and what
 * that check established. It may NOT convert an integrity result into a
 * conclusion about human authorship, identity, intent, consent, or legal
 * validity; and where a check fails it must describe the failed check rather
 * than characterise the signature, signer, document or legal effect as invalid.
 *
 * ── This is a Global Core control, not a regional overlay ───────────────────
 * The control has a name: **Verification Claim Integrity**. The
 * rule is written down here because it is load-bearing under FOUR regimes at
 * once, none of which is a single jurisdiction's overlay:
 *
 *   1. FTC Act §5            — a deceptive claim about what a product verified.
 *   2. State UDAP statutes   — the same claim, actionable state by state.
 *   3. Contract expectation  — we told the customer the check proved X.
 *   4. Evidentiary integrity — an overclaim in the product undermines the very
 *                              record it decorates when the record is produced.
 *
 * So this gate does NOT go away if a regional overlay goes out of scope. It is
 * written here in the positive because the failure mode is a future reader
 * deleting a control they took for a leftover of some other regime's rules.
 *
 * This exists because the rule is forward-looking. The two strings that
 * prompted it ("Signature Verified" / "Invalid Signature") are gone, but the
 * same claim keeps reappearing in disguise — "Identity
 * Verified", "Consent Verified", "Agreement Validated", "Legally Binding",
 * "Verified Document", and later "Authentic Signature", "Genuine
 * Signature", "Valid Signature", "Legally Valid Signature", "Signer Verified",
 * "Authorized Signature", "Confirmed by [person]" and "Signed by [person]" —
 * and a policy document does not stop any of them landing in a catalogue.
 *
 * What IS permitted is the claim narrowed to the check that ran: "Signature
 * image integrity check passed", or more precisely "The stored signature image
 * matches the signature image fingerprint recorded at signing." A disclaimer
 * does not rescue an over-broad claim — narrow the claim.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately the MESSAGE CATALOGUES, every locale. The finding that
 * started this was that the wording had already been translated, and the
 * translation stated the claim more flatly than the English did.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-verification-copy.mjs [--self-test]

 * Policy: docs/develop/verification-copy-policy.md

/**
 * The gate must be able to fail, and must be able NOT to fail.
 *
 * `MUST_FLAG` is the claim in each disguise listed above. `MUST_NOT_FLAG` is
 * the careful wording those disguises get replaced with — including the two
 * real strings the negation-blind first version flagged. A pattern that drifts
 * in either direction turns a clean scan into a false green, and the second
 * direction is the expensive one: a gate that punishes the disclaimer teaches
 * people to remove the disclaimer.
 *
 * ── The eight later claims each reuse an ordinary product word. So each of
 *    those rules below carries a REAL string from these
 *    catalogues as its negative control, and the three that needed narrowing
 *    say so here, because the narrowing is the whole design: ──
 *
 *  - "valid" is everywhere ("Enter a valid email", "Confirmation links are
 *    valid for 7 days", "Connected — key is valid"). The rule is the ADJECTIVAL
 *    form only — `valid signature` / `firma válida`. The PREDICATE form is
 *    deliberately NOT banned: in "Audit chain is intact and Ed25519 signatures
 *    are valid" the subject is the cryptographic signature and the claim is
 *    exactly the check that ran.
 *  - "authorized" ships in "Authorized representative", "Authorize access", and
 *    the whole connected-apps surface. The rule requires the word to land on
 *    the noun `signature` / `firma`.
 *  - "Signed by" / "Firmado por" are REAL CAPTIONS in this repository — the
 *    printable agreement and the PCA report both use them as a bare field label
 *    over a rendered image. A caption is not a claim. The prohibition is
 *    written "[person]", and the attribution only exists once an identity is
 *    interpolated, so the rule requires the placeholder that supplies it.
 *
 * "authentic" and "genuine" appear in neither catalogue in any form, so those
 * two rules carry no negative control of their own; there is nothing real to
 * protect and inventing one would only test the invention.
