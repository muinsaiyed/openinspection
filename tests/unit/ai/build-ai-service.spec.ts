/**
 * The CONSTRUCTION site of the AI enforcement chain.
 *
 * `checkAiQuota` spent its whole life written, tested, and reading a delivered
 * allowance while having zero production callers. Wiring it fixed that — and
 * moved the same failure one step outward, to the line that injects the
 * pre-flight into the service. Measured 2026-08-11: replacing that argument
 * with `undefined` left `tests/unit/usage/ai-quota.spec.ts` and
 * `tests/unit/ai/resolve-provider.spec.ts` at **39 passed**. Every existing case
 * builds an `AIService` by hand, so none of them can see the builder that
 * production actually goes through (`server/lib/middleware/di.ts`).
 *
 * These cases are the ones that go red when the injection disappears.
 *
 * They assert the wiring, not the runtime behaviour, and that is deliberate:
 * `callGemini` consults the capability gate BEFORE the pre-flight
 * (`services/ai.service.ts:194` vs `:208`), and that gate refuses every managed
 * output class until 08-07 Task 6 flips it. So no end-to-end call can reach the
 * pre-flight today. Reaching through `private quota` is the price of pinning a
 * link whose behaviour is deliberately unreachable; when the gate opens, prefer
 * a behavioural case and delete this reach-through.
