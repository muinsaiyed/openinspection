 *  idempotent upsert; safe to apply out of sequence order.
 *
 * ── The account and its acceptance are ONE write ────────────────────────────
 * The invariant is enforced the strict way
 * rather than the obvious way. Enqueuing the acceptance atomically with the
 * account insert and letting the portal ledger catch up came back
 * `FAIL-CLOSED NOT SATISFIED`: an outbox proves *acceptance evidence was
 * durably captured*, not *acceptance was recorded in the acceptance ledger
 * before account creation*, and while the event sits unconsumed the state is
 * `account = EXISTS, acceptance_ledger = ABSENT`. So the `users` row and its
 * acceptance rows go into one `db.batch()` — D1's only atomic primitive — and
 * there is no sequential fallback for drivers that lack `batch`. A fallback
 * loop (the idiom in `lib/db/assignment-links.ts`, correct for its own
 * purposes) would silently reopen exactly the window that was refused.
 *
 * ── The asymmetry between the branches is the design ────────────────────────
 * INSERT creates an account, so it owes an acceptance and REFUSES without one.
 * UPDATE rotates a credential on an account that already exists — it creates
 * nothing, and demanding an acceptance there would refuse a password change for
 * somebody who accepted years ago.
 *
 * ── Why the refusal is loud rather than a park ──────────────────────────────
 * A credential-bearing command that would create an account with no acceptance
 * is not a message we cannot understand; it is one we understand and must not
 * obey. Throwing exhausts the queue retries and surfaces it as a `failed` row
 * against the tenant that is stuck, where somebody is still looking. Parking it
 * would file it under "shape we do not recognise", which is a different and
 * false diagnosis.
