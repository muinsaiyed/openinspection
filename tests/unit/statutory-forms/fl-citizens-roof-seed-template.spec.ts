/**
 * The template that produces the Citizens roof form, against the map of that form.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE TREC SPEC AGAIN ──────────────────
 * TREC's template gets away with one embedded rating system because all 41 of
 * its items ask the same question. This form asks TWELVE different ones over
 * fourteen values, so there is no single axis to check — the correspondence that
 * can go silently wrong here is per question: the value an inspector's answer is
 * STORED as must equal that question's own `whenValue` on the map, character for
 * character, because `render.ts` matches with `===` and nothing normalises.
 *
 * A template that stored the printed label instead ("Full replacement" rather
 * than `full_replacement`) renders a COMPLETELY BLANK official form. Nothing
 * throws: `checkChoicesAreReachable` only refuses an answer that was given, and
 * the boxes simply stay unticked. That failure has happened on this branch once
 * already, which is why the vocabulary check below is the crux of this file.
