    // Every project still shares ONE wrangler-dev worker + ONE local D1
    // (globalSetup seeds it once), so this cannot go wide. It no longer has to
    // be 1, though: the three reasons it was are gone.
    //
    //   1. Several specs raced POST /api/auth/setup with DIFFERENT company
    //      names, so whichever won named the tenant. They now all send the one
    //      COMPANY_NAME from helpers/tenant-identity and depend on `api`, so a
    //      late setup 409s harmlessly instead of renaming the workspace.
    //   2. Four specs shelled out to `wrangler d1 execute --local` mid-test to
    //      re-hash an admin password that already had that exact value, and
    //      those calls locked the SQLite file. They are deleted. No spec in
    //      the default run shells out to the wrangler CLI any more —
    //      calendar-connect was the last one and now writes through the worker
    //      (calendar-connect.spec.ts), and the only remaining CLI user,
    //      core.integration.spec.ts, is excluded by `testIgnore` below. So
    //      nothing in a default run holds the SQLite lock.
    //   3. Ten projects were handed the SAME seeded inspection, which only ever
    //      worked because they ran one at a time. The first run at 3 workers
    //      duly failed: SpeedMode found nothing left to rate after a concurrent
    //      spec had rated it. helpers/editor-seed.ts now seeds one inspection
    //      per editing project. (This reason was missed when 1 and 2 were fixed
    //      — the list above was written from what made the CLI and setup race,
    //      not from an audit of what else the projects share.)
    //

        // an observed collision, but one serial slot spent so the newly-real
        // 25-request burst and people-role-profiles' three UI logins are not
        // released simultaneously by their shared `editor-seed` dependency. It
