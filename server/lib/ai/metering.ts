/**
 * The two halves of "check before, meter after" for AI, built once per request
 * and injected into AIService.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a second metering system: it writes through the same
 * `MeteringService` into the same `usage_counters` table under the same
 * `currentPeriodKey` bucket as sms/email, and it is wired at exactly one
 * chokepoint — the single method every AI feature funnels through. The email
 * pipeline learned this the expensive way: one unified interface is the meter,
 * and any counter added beside it becomes a second number that must agree with
 * the first and eventually doesn't.
 *
 * The pre-flight is separate from the meter and shaped like the email one
 * (`lib/email/build-email-service.ts`: `{ preflight }` beside `{ record }`) for
 * the reason stated on `PlanQuotaGuard.checkAiQuota` — the check is read-only,
 * so a model call that failed never consumes an allowance it did not spend.
 * AI calls fail more often than sends, which makes that ordering matter more
 * here, not less.
 *
 * The credential source that tags the metric and selects the cap comes from
 * `resolveAi` — the same resolver the runtime uses to decide which key the call
 * runs on — rather than from a separate "is this managed?" test that could
 * disagree with it.
