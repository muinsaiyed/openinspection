/**
 * OI #58 — the non-translatable content registry.
 *
 * ELEVEN CATEGORIES of content ride inside the inspection report, the
 * inspection agreement and the records taken alongside them: reliance clauses,
 * limitation of liability, arbitration, warranty disclaimer, governing law,
 * contract terms, signatures, acknowledgements, legal notices, consents and
 * waivers, and statutory certification language. The rule is one sentence long
 * and it is the reason this file exists: these are not *content*, they are a
 * legal instrument.
 *
 * English is authoritative for every entry below. None of it is eligible for
 * machine translation, and none of it is eligible for the message catalogue
 * either — a courtesy translation of a term is still the term arriving in a
 * language nobody agreed to be bound in.
 *
 * ## This registry has NO runtime effect today, and that is the point
 *
 * The `translation` output class is now RELEASED on a workspace's own provider
 * key and still refused on a platform key
 * (`server/lib/ai/output-classification.ts`; `legal_text` stays `prohibited` on
 * both). What does NOT exist is a pipeline: nothing segments a report and
 * nothing calls for a translation of one, so there is still no consumer for
 * this list. It remains a PRECONDITION of #23 rather than a feature of it: the
 * register has to exist, and be enforced, before the pipeline that would
 * otherwise have to remember every category at review time.
 *
 * ⚠️ The release is why this file matters more than it did, not less. While the
 * capability was refused outright, an omission here could not reach a client;
 * now the only thing between these categories and a model is that no
 * caller has been written yet.
 *
 * ⚠️ Read the direction of the rule correctly. This is NOT an exemption list
 * carved out of a permission — today nothing may be machine-translated at all.
 * It is an enumeration of what stays English **even after** #23 opens the door.
 * Nothing here licenses translating anything that is not here; the out-of-scope
 * register (`non-translatable-out-of-scope.ts`) is where "translatable, and here
 * is why" is written down, and it is deliberately short.
 *
 * ⚠️ And read the direction of ENFORCEMENT correctly too. This register is not
 * what a pipeline filters against. A filter built from a list of forbidden
 * things silently re-opens the moment the payload it filters grows a field, and
 * that has already happened once here: the assembled reliance block reaches the
 * report payload as `relianceText` and no exclusion list in the codebase would
 * have kept it out. What decides eligibility is an enumeration of PERMITTED
 * spans, built independently; this register is the classification that
 * enumeration is checked against, not the check itself.
 *
 * ## Platform notices are a DIFFERENT module — do not merge them in
 *
 * `server/lib/legal/report-view-disclosure.ts` (the Art. 13 report-view notice)
 * and `server/lib/legal/agreement-language-disclosure.ts` (the neutral
 * disclosure shown alongside an agreement) are platform notices. The second is
 * a *neutral platform disclosure*:
 * it states a fact while deciding nothing. A notice ABOUT the instrument is not
 * a term OF the instrument, and conflating the two would either freeze copy that
 * benefits from being read in the recipient's language or license translating
 * terms that must not be. Both are listed in the out-of-scope register with the
 * reason, so the boundary is written down rather than remembered.
 *
 * ## Why entries reference a PATH and a LOCATOR instead of importing anything
 *
 * Two reasons, and the first one is not aesthetic.
 *
 *  1. `server/services/inspection/inspection-report.service.ts` and
 *     `server/api/public-report.ts` sit at their large-file-ratchet cap with
 *     ZERO headroom (`scripts/file-size-baseline.json`). One added import line
 *     fails `npm run lint:filesize`. The signature block genuinely lives in the
 *     first of those, so the registry names it by path and the gate reads the
 *     file as text.
 *  2. Half the subjects are not importable values at all. They are D1 columns
 *     (`agreements.content`, `agreement_signers.signature_base64`), a template
 *     field a tenant fills in (`disclaimerText`), and prose inside a seeded
 *     fixture. A registry of content KINDS is compile-time knowledge that is
 *     identical for every tenant; it is not a table and it is not a module
 *     graph.
 *
 * The cost of naming things by string is that a rename silently empties the
 * register. That is what the gate is for: it fails when a `source` no longer
 * exists, when a `locator` no longer appears in it, and when it parses zero
 * entries. See `scripts/check-non-translatable.mjs`.
 */

/**
 * The eleven categories. A CLOSED set.
 *
 * The gate carries its own copy of this list and compares the two in both
 * directions, because a gate whose scope is a private constant is a gate that
 * can be narrowed by editing the thing it checks.
 *
 * The last three were added when the classification was written down in full.
 * `contract_terms` and `signature` are wider than they strictly need to be and
 * that is deliberate — this set is a floor, and no entry here is ever narrowed
 * to make room for a new one.
 *
