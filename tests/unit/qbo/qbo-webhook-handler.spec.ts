/**
 * The webhook is an UNAUTHENTICATED public endpoint that names its own tenant.
 *
 * `POST /webhooks/quickbooks` is excluded from JWT middleware, so the
 * only thing standing between the open internet and a tenant's books is the
 * `intuit-signature` HMAC — and the only thing that decides WHOSE books get
 * written is a realm id read out of the request body. Both live in
 * `handleWebhook` itself (the route reads the raw bytes and hands them over),
 * so both are tested here.
 *
 * The other half is robustness: Intuit retries anything that is not a 200, so
 * the route answers 200 immediately and runs this in the background. A handler
 * that throws on a payload it does not recognise therefore fails where nobody
 * is watching, and takes the rest of the batch with it.
 *
 * The signature is recomputed in the test with node's `crypto`, not with the
 * service's own WebCrypto path — an independent implementation, so these
 * specs prove the handler matches base64 HMAC-SHA256 rather than proving it
 * agrees with itself.
