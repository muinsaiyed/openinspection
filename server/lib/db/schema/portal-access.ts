/**
 * Persistent per-(recipient, order) portal access tokens (Magic-Link, no-login).
 *
 * ONE stable row per (inspection, recipient); the token does NOT rotate per
 * email-send (so every automation email/SMS reuses the same link across the
 * order lifecycle — sign → pay → view report → download PDF). Each recipient
 * (client / co_client / agent) gets a distinct token for attribution.
 *
 * Lifecycle: issued on order-create / recipient-add; `expiresAt` set ~30–60d
 * after report delivery; `revokedAt` set by the inspector "Reset access link".
 * Timestamps are plain epoch-ms integers (numeric comparison in the guard).
 * ONE TOKEN OPENS EVERY REPORT ON THE ORDER, deliberately. An order can now
 * deliver several documents — a standard report and a radon report — and the
 * token stays keyed on the INSPECTION, not on a report. One order, one client,
 * one link: a per-report token would mean three links in three emails for one
 * job, and a client who mislaid the middle one.
 *
 * The delivery-confirmation counter (`report_views` below) keys on this row's
 * id: the token says WHO opened something, and — until the public renderer
 * gains per-report identity — the inspection says WHAT, at order granularity.
 *
 * See memory project_client_portal_token_model.

/**
 * Report delivery confirmation — OI #271. Three counters per (recipient,
 * deliverable-as-observed), written SERVER-SIDE when a report page is actually
 * rendered to a human who presented a live portal token.
 *
 * This is delivery confirmation, NOT engagement analytics. Nothing is stored on
 * or read from the recipient's device — no cookie, pixel, localStorage,
 * sendBeacon, or client listener — so ePrivacy Art. 5(3) is not engaged and the
 * lawful basis is legitimate interests. The full assessment, including the
 * conditions it rests on, is `docs/compliance/report-view-lia.md`.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: IP address, user agent, referrer, device fingerprint,
 * per-section dwell, scroll depth. Each would need its own erasure rule,
 * retention window and justification, and none of them answers "was it
 * received". The absence is the design, not an oversight.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO `report_id`. An order can carry several deliverables
 * (`reports` rows of kind primary/ancillary), but the public report surface has
 * no report identity: the route is `report-view/:tenant/:id` where `:id` is an
 * INSPECTION id, and the renderer never sees a `reports.id`. Two shortcuts were
 * rejected. Putting an inspection id in a `report_id` column is a false record
 * in a column whose name asserts otherwise. Guessing the primary report via
 * `resolvePrimaryReportId()` manufactures a specific factual assertion about an
 * identified person ("this recipient opened the radon report") out of an
 * observation that does not contain it — LIA §3.4(b) rejects it on accuracy.
 *
 * So the row records ONLY what the system observed: this recipient rendered the
 * report page for this ORDER. When the renderer gains real per-report identity,
 * a `report_id` column can be appended and the older rows stay honestly
 * order-scoped rather than retroactively mislabelled. (LIA §3.4 option 3;
 * resolves condition 3.)
 *
 * WHO is the access token, not the email: the token row is already one per
 * (inspection, recipient) by unique index, it carries the role, and it is what
 * subject erasure deletes — so keying on it makes these rows die with the
 * recipient's access rather than outlive it.
 *
 * Erasure: rows are DELETED by `access_token_id`, and must be deleted BEFORE
 * `inspection_access_tokens` (the token id is the only locator). An all-zero
 * row would still record that this person was sent this report.
