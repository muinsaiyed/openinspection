// tests/unit/reports/psq-responses.spec.ts
//
// `psq_responses` holds the ASTM E2018 §8.5 Pre-Survey Questionnaire — the
// point-of-contact's own account of the property's history, and a MANDATORY
// exhibit of a full PCA. The behaviour the table exists for is therefore not
// "store some answers": it is that the questionnaire's fate is always on the
// record. Obtained, refused, or never returned, the report has to be able to
// say which, because the conformance verdict downstream reads that status and a
// missing exhibit only stays conformant when it was DISCLOSED.
//
// Existing coverage stops at the happy path (pca-compliance-service.spec.ts:
// upsert then read; compliance-routes.spec.ts: the decline -> Deviations
// side-effect). What was untested is the storage-level invariants those two
// rest on, which is what this file pins.
