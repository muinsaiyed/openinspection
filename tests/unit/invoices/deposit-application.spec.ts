/**
 * A held deposit becoming an invoice payment — and, just as load-bearing, NOT
 * becoming one when it should stay held.
 *
 * Under GAAP a customer deposit is a liability until the work is delivered, so
 * it lives against the ORDER with a null `invoice_id`. This is the one moment
 * it moves, and three things have to be true afterwards or money appears in one
 * place and not another:
 *
 *  1. The invoice's cached `amount_paid_cents` reflects it. That column has
 *     exactly one writer, and backfilling rows underneath it without calling
 *     that writer is how a cache and a ledger drift apart for three weeks.
 *  2. The REPORT STAYS LOCKED. $90 against $450 is partial, and a deposit is a
 *     scheduling instrument, not the thing that releases a report. This is the
 *     assertion the whole feature is one bug away from failing.
 *  3. The held total goes to ZERO — which is also what the QBO Books health
 *     card counts, so the "not yet synced to QuickBooks" figure must fall by
 *     one when a deposit is applied. A count that only ever grows is a count
 *     nobody trusts.
