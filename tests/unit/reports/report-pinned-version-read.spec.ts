/**
 * Reading a PINNED published version.
 *
 * Two separate claims, and they fail in different ways:
 *
 *   1. The version travels inside the SIGNED render token, never as a query
 *      param. A link holder who could append `&v=1` to a report URL would be
 *      asking the renderer for a version they were never sent.
 *   2. When a version is named, the fields the snapshot captured come from it.
 *      Before this, the "frozen" per-version PDF was rendered from the LIVE page
 *      the first time somebody downloaded it — so the freezing was a caching
 *      side effect, and a v3 PDF nobody had fetched would be generated from data
 *      as it stood whenever they got round to it.
