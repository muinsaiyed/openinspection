/**
 * Ratchets on the D1 statements the global middleware chain spends.
 *
 * Why this gate exists at all: a single page render fans out 15 in-process API
 * calls through the self-binding in `workers/app.ts`, and Hono runs the whole
 * `app.use('*')` chain on every one of them. Measured 2026-09-06, before any
 * memoisation, one `GET /inspections/:id` render cost 143 D1 statements and
 * 105 of them (73%) were that one chain running over and over. The saving is a
 * number only an instrument can see, so the instrument ships with the change.
 *
 * There are TWO numbers here and they move in opposite ways on purpose:
 *
 *   COLD_FLOOR   one call, NO request scope — the external HTTP path. It must
 *                NOT move. Memoisation is unreachable from outside by
 *                construction, so a drop here would mean the scope leaked into
 *                `toApi` and external requests had started sharing auth
 *                decisions. This is the security argument in executable form.
 *   FANOUT_TOTAL several calls sharing ONE scope — the in-process render path.
 *                This is the number each memoisation task lowers.
 *
 * A gate with only the cold number could never observe the effect it exists to
 * observe: with no scope in the env every `memoOnce` falls through to its
 * factory, so the cold count is unchanged by definition.
 *
 * The probe is unauthenticated on purpose. A 401 pays the same middleware floor
 * as a 200 — the expensive work is gated on the `/api/` path prefix, not on
 * whether a token verified — so the probe needs no session to measure the chain.
 *
 * `/api/event-types` is the probe because its own handler issued 0 statements
 * in the reference measurement, so its total IS the middleware floor. If that
 * endpoint ever grows its own query these numbers stop meaning "floor"; the
 * comments below say how to re-derive them.

 * That is why this reads 10 where a seeded dev worker reads 9 — the number is
