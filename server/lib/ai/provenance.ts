/**
 * The AI provenance sink, built once per request and injected into AIService.
 *
 * Shaped exactly like `metering.ts` and for the same reason: there is ONE
 * chokepoint (`AIService.callGemini`) and everything that must happen on every
 * AI call is wired there, as an injected seam rather than as a call the service
 * makes for itself. A second write site somewhere else would be a second answer
 * to "what ran", and two records of one call eventually disagree.
 *
 * WHERE THE FACTS COME FROM, AND WHY THEY ARE SPLIT THE WAY THEY ARE.
 *   - tenant / mode / model are REQUEST-scoped and arrive here already
 *     resolved, from the same single credential read in `di.ts` that tags the
 *     meter and answers the capability gate. Re-resolving them here would
 *     create a third opinion about whose key a call runs on, and the whole
 *     point of the injected picture is that there is only one.
 *   - capability / promptVersion / provider are CALL-scoped and come from the
 *     chokepoint: the workload it is running, the version token of the prompt
 *     it rendered, and the id of the adapter instance it is about to call. The
 *     provider id is read off the adapter rather than off configuration so the
 *     row names the backend that actually ran.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE: the prompt. Not truncated, not hashed, not "just the first
 * line". See the schema comment on `ai_call_provenance` — the entry type below
 * has no field that could carry it, which is the enforcement.
 *
 * WHAT A ROW PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Everything written here is OBSERVED
 * at the chokepoint: the workload that ran, the prompt version that was
 * rendered, and the id and destination of the adapter instance about to be
 * called. So a row is evidence that a call was made, which backend it was made
 * to and where that backend lives. It is NOT evidence that the workspace's
 * stored ATTESTATION about that backend was accurate — an attestation is a
 * statement someone made, and comparing the two is the point: a row and an
 * attestation that name different destinations is the disagreement worth
 * seeing.
