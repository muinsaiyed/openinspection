# es-419 translation glossary

One equivalent per term, decided once. The catalogue is thousands of keys across
three dozen module files in `messages/` — `npm run lint:i18n-glossary` prints
the live key count on every run, so read it there rather than from a figure
frozen into this sentence. Without a fixed term list the same noun acquires four
translations across those files and the result reads as machine output.

This file is **machine-read** — but only in part, and the difference matters.
`npm run lint:i18n-glossary` (`scripts/check-i18n-glossary.mjs`) parses the
tables below and holds `messages/es-419/**` to exactly four things:

- the **Never** column of every `<!-- gate:terms -->` table — a translation
  containing a ruled-out word fails the build;
- the `<!-- gate:literal -->` table — a string that must reach the reader
  byte-identical (`STOP`, `pk_test_`, `label,floor`) and did not;
- **placeholders** — `{name}` tokens must be the same set in both locales;
- **consistency** — character-identical English must have identical Spanish,
  unless the keys are declared under `<!-- gate:divergence -->`.

Everything else here is prose a human has to honour. In particular the
**es-419** column is *not* compared against the catalogue: no gate can tell that
*informe* is the word the translator should have reached for. That column is
checked only for self-consistency — a term this file bans in one row can never
be the term it approves in another — and the rest is review.

The gate refuses to run at all on a document it cannot fully parse: an unknown
table header, a marker not sitting directly above its table, prose in a Never
column, or any section shrinking below `scripts/i18n-glossary-baseline.json`.
That strictness is the lesson of its own history — every time this gate went
quiet it was reading *less*, never reading something wrong. Edit the table, not
the gate; if a section legitimately shrinks, run
`node scripts/check-i18n-glossary.mjs --update` and commit the baseline with it.

## Status of the Spanish catalogue

English is the authoritative locale. `es-419` is a courtesy layer: a key with no
Spanish translation falls back to English at runtime, which is safe. A key
present but **empty** is not — it renders blank. Never commit `"key": ""`.

Legally operative text is **not** translated. Inspection agreements and platform
terms stay English, and their body text is tenant/authored content that does not
live in this catalogue at all. Chrome *around* those documents (buttons, table
headers, status labels) is ordinary UI and is translated.

## Register

**Formal *usted*, second person.** Not *tú*, and not *vos*.

The reason is regional reach, not politeness. `es-419` spans voseo countries
(Argentina, Uruguay, much of Central America) where the *tú* imperative is
audibly foreign — "Ingresa" against "Ingresá". *Usted* is the one second person
that is correct everywhere in the region, so it is the only choice that lets a
single catalogue serve all of it. It is also the register a business uses when
writing to a client about their house.

Consequences, all machine-enforced below:

- Possessive is **su / sus**, never *tu / tus*.
- Imperatives take the *usted* form: **Ingrese**, **Guarde**, **Seleccione**.
- Clitic is **le / lo / la**, never *te*.
- Write **usted** in full where it is needed at all; never abbreviate to *Ud.*
- Latin American vocabulary, never Castilian: *computadora* not *ordenador*,
  *archivo* not *fichero*.

**Sentence case for buttons and labels**, matching the English UI: "Guardar
cambios", not "Guardar Cambios". Spanish sentence case also means months,
weekdays and languages are lowercase — but those come from `Intl`, not from this
catalogue.

## Rules that outrank the tables

1. **Translate what English says — do not fix English.** The English catalogue
   has known inconsistencies (four words for one trade concept; "Roles" against
   "Inspection roles"). Unifying them in Spanish desynchronises the two
   catalogues and hides the English problem. Terminology renames are an
   English-side pass; this is not it.
2. **Placeholders are part of the string.** `{address}`, `{count}`, `{status}`
   must survive translation with the same names — a dropped or renamed
   placeholder compiles to a different function signature and breaks the call
   site. Enforced.
3. **Do not translate the product name.** OpenInspection stays OpenInspection.
4. **Do not translate through the key name.** Keys are English identifiers and
   several of them lie about their own copy — the `settings_profile_credentials_*`
   family renders "Licenses & affiliations", not "Credentials". Translate the
   value in front of you.
5. **Tenant data is not in scope.** Rating-system labels, template names, canned
   comment bodies, inspection-role labels and trade names live in the database
   and stay in whatever language the tenant typed. A tenant who renamed their
   rating scale sees their own words, not these.
6. **Numbers, dates, money and addresses are formatted by code**
   (`app/lib/format.ts`, `app/lib/money.ts`), never spelled into a message. Do
   not hardcode a currency symbol or a date pattern in a translated string.
7. **A format literal a parser matches on stays English.** Some strings show the
   user an input format that code then compares against, character for
   character. `editor_unitsmanager_csv_placeholder` and `_csv_hint` show
   `label,floor`, and `parseUnitCsv` (`server/lib/unit-pattern.ts`) skips a
   header row only when it reads exactly that. Translating the hint to
   `etiqueta,piso` would teach a Spanish user to type a header the parser then
   imports as a unit named "etiqueta". Translate the prose around such a
   literal; leave the literal alone. The literals themselves are listed in the
   next section and enforced from there — this rule explains *why*, that table
   is *what*.

---

## Literals that must survive translation

Rules 3 and 7 above name strings that have to reach the reader unchanged. Naming
them in a paragraph made them advice; this table makes them a check. For every
row, **any `messages/en` value containing the literal must have an `es-419`
value containing it byte-identically** — same case, same punctuation. A key with
no Spanish yet is fine: it falls back to English, which is the correct string by
definition.

A row belongs here when some rule in this file already says the string stays
English *and* getting it wrong is not a matter of taste. The three classes are:
a value a parser or a carrier matches on (`label,floor`, `STOP`), a sample of a
format the user must reproduce (`pk_test_`, `+15551234567`), and a proper noun
(`OpenInspection`, `Stripe`). Words that merely *look* invariant do not qualify:
`GDPR` is *RGPD* in Spanish and "Resend" is *Reenviar* when it is the verb — both
are in the tables below, where a human decides, not in here.

Rows are matched as plain substrings, so keep them distinctive. The gate fails
if a listed literal appears in no English value at all — a typo here would
otherwise protect nothing while looking like protection.

<!-- gate:literal -->

| Literal | Where it appears | Why it stays English |
|---|---|---|
| `label,floor` | the unit-CSV placeholder and hint | `parseUnitCsv` (`server/lib/unit-pattern.ts`) skips the header row only on this exact text; a translated hint teaches the user to type a header that then imports as a unit. |
| `radon_pickup` | the event-type slug sample | A sample of a URL-safe key the user copies. See the Slug row. |
| `STOP` | SMS consent copy, compliance panels | The word a consumer texts back to opt out. Carriers match it; a translated one is a compliance failure, not a typo. |
| `START` | SMS consent copy, provider webhooks | Re-subscribe keyword, same reason as STOP. |
| `HELP` | SMS consent copy, provider webhooks | Help keyword, same reason as STOP. |
| `pk_test_` | Stripe key-field hints | A key prefix the user checks their own credential against. |
| `sk_test_` | Stripe key-field hints | As above. |
| `whsec_` | Stripe webhook-secret hints | As above. |
| `SG.` | SendGrid key-field hint | As above. The trailing dot is part of the prefix. |
| `acct_1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnO` | Stripe account-id sample | A format sample. |
| `+15551234567` | phone-number format samples | E.164 sample; a localised one would be a wrong number. |
| `customer.cloudflarestream.com` | Stream subdomain hint | A hostname the user pastes. |
| `Account SID` | Twilio credential fields | The field is labelled this in Twilio's console; a translated label sends the user hunting. |
| `Auth Token` | Twilio credential fields | As above. |
| `Send test event` | Stripe webhook setup steps | The label of a button the user clicks *in Stripe*. |
| `OpenInspection` | product name, 87 keys | Rule 3. |
| `Stripe` | payments settings and checkout | Vendor name. |
| `Twilio` | SMS settings | Vendor name. |
| `Telnyx` | SMS settings | Vendor name. |
| `SendGrid` | email settings | Vendor name. |
| `Postmark` | email settings | Vendor name. |
| `Mailgun` | email settings | Vendor name. |
| `QuickBooks` | accounting integration | Vendor name. |
| `Cloudflare` | infrastructure copy | Vendor name. |
| `Google` | calendar and places integrations | Vendor name. |
| `Turnstile` | booking bot protection | Product name. |
| `10DLC` | SMS registration copy | The carrier programme's name. |
| `TCR` | SMS registration copy | The Campaign Registry, a proper noun. |
| `ASTM` | commercial report copy | Standards body. |
| `PCA` | commercial report copy | Acronym of the standard — see the Commercial PCA table. |
| `PSQ` | commercial report copy | As above. |
| `PCR` | commercial report copy | As above. |
| `EUL` | commercial cost tables | As above. |
| `RUL` | commercial cost tables | As above. |
| `N/A` | severity and field values | Abbreviates *no aplica* in Spanish — same letters, same expansion. |

## Product nouns

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inspection | inspección | orden de trabajo | The canonical noun. English forbids "Order"/"Job"; Spanish must not reintroduce them. |
| Company | empresa | compañía | One word for the business. "Compañía" is not wrong Spanish, it is just a second word for the same thing. |
| Workspace | espacio de trabajo | — | Appears only in the login heading. Not a user-facing concept elsewhere — do not spread it. |
| Report | informe | reporte | Region-neutral and unambiguous. "Reporte" is common in some markets, but picking both is how one noun becomes two. |
| Template | plantilla | — | Standard software Spanish. |
| Finding | hallazgo | — | Rare in the UI (a repair-request column, a metrics chart). Distinct from *defecto*: a hallazgo is observed, a defecto is judged. |
| Defect | defecto | — | The severity level. See the rating table. |
| Repair Items | elementos de reparación | — | English forbids "Recommendations" **for this feature**, and so does Spanish — but that prohibition cannot be a machine ban. English uses the same word legitimately elsewhere: the ASTM PCA report's "1.5 Recommendations" section, the "Recommendation" custom-defect category, and the agent portal's "grouped under Recommendations". A blanket ban on *recomendaciones* false-fires on all of them, and a gate with false positives gets bypassed. Rule, not gate: never name **this feature** *recomendaciones*. |
| Repair Request | solicitud de reparación | — | The client-facing document built from repair items. |
| Canned Comment | comentario predefinido | comentario enlatado | "Enlatado" is a literal calque of the English idiom and reads as a joke. |
| Notes | notas | apuntes | Inspector free text. Keep distinct from *comentarios*. |
| Comments | comentarios | — | Library entries and message threads. Never merge with *notas*. |
| Booking | reserva | — | The public self-scheduling flow. "Online Booking" → "Reservas en línea". |
| Appointment | cita | — | A scheduled visit. Deliberately a different word from *reserva*. |
| Schedule (noun) | agenda | — | |
| Schedule (verb) | programar | — | The verb. For the *status* "Scheduled" see the Status labels section — it is *Programado*, masculine, and that section explains why. |
| Invoice | factura | — | |
| Estimate | presupuesto | — | The **noun** for a priced offer. Not *estimado*, which reads as a guess. The ban is on the noun only and is deliberately not machine-enforced: *estimado* is the ordinary adjective and the only right word in "Estimated cost" → *Costo estimado* and "Estimated monthly cost" → *Costo mensual estimado*. Banning the string would false-fire on both. |
| Agreement | acuerdo | — | The document itself stays in English; this is the word for it in chrome. |
| Trade | oficio | — | The contractor discipline. English also says "contractor type" and "recommended contractor" for adjacent things — translate each as written (rule 1). |
| Contractor | contratista | — | |
| Property | propiedad | — | |
| Licenses & affiliations | licencias y afiliaciones | — | The `settings_profile_credentials_*` family. This is licences plus association memberships — **not** login credentials. |
| Credentials (sign-in / provider secrets) | credenciales | — | Only for authentication: the login form, and email/SMS/accounting provider secrets. Never for the licences feature above. |
| Library | biblioteca | — | The reusable-content area: templates, canned comments, repair items, tags, agreements, rating systems. |
| Marketplace | Marketplace | — | Left in English. It is a feature name, it is the word Latin American software actually uses, and the `MP` badge that abbreviates it has no Spanish equivalent. *Mercado* is deliberately not banned — "market value" is a legitimate phrase elsewhere in the product. |
| Dashboard | panel | — | "Back to Dashboard" → *Volver al panel*. Not *tablero*, which this product needs for the electrical panel. |
| Tag | etiqueta | — | The library tagging feature. |
| Label (of a template item) | etiqueta | — | The same word as Tag, on purpose. Both are *etiqueta* in ordinary Spanish, they never appear on the same surface, and inventing *rótulo* for one of them would be a word nobody uses to avoid a collision nobody sees. |
| Severity | gravedad | — | Not *severidad*, which is an anglicism in this sense. |
| Rating | calificación | — | "Rating system" → *sistema de calificación*; "Rating icons" → *iconos de calificación*. |
| Est. min / Est. max | Est. mín / Est. máx | — | The abbreviated repair-cost range on a repair item. Kept abbreviated because the field is a narrow numeric input, and *est.* abbreviates *estimado* in Spanish exactly as it does in English. The Estimate row still bans the unabbreviated *estimado*: that ban is about the noun for a priced offer, not about this abbreviation. |
| Amended (a report) | modificado | — | "Report amended" → *Informe modificado*. The feature is a revision after publication, not a legislative amendment, so not *enmendado*. |

## Roles and parties

The same handful of role words appears in a dozen places — the team settings
page, the invite modal, the inspection people list, the signer list, the message
thread, the public verify page. They must read identically in all of them; the
gate compares them against each other.

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Owner (account role) | Titular | — | *Propietario* is the property owner — a different person, in a product whose whole subject is someone's house. "Titular" is the account holder and carries no such collision. |
| Manager (account role) | Gerente | — | Not *Administrador*, which reads as a system admin. |
| Inspector | Inspector | — | Same word. Feminine *Inspectora* only where the string is about one known person. |
| Agent | Agente | — | Real-estate agent. |
| Client | Cliente | — | English forbids "Customer"; do not reach for *consumidor*. |
| Co-Client | Cliente secundario | — | Spanish has no "co-" formation here, and the codebase's own name for the concept is the secondary client. |
| Other | Otro | — | The role bucket, masculine to agree with *rol*. |
| Contact | Contacto | — | The label English gives the `other` message role. The divergence is English's; keep it. |
| Signer | Firmante | — | |
| Recipient | Destinatario | — | |
| Staff | personal | — | "Office staff" → *personal de oficina*. |
| Team | equipo | — | |
| Field Observer | Observador de campo | — | Commercial sign-off role. |
| PCR Reviewer | Revisor del PCR | — | PCR stays an acronym; it names a document type. |

### Roles that are database seeds, not catalogue keys

`Buyer's Agent`, `Listing Agent`, `Attorney`, `Transaction Coordinator`,
`Insurance Agent` and `Title Company` are seeded labels in
`server/lib/people/default-role-profiles.ts`, and tenants can rename them. None
of them has a message key today, and **no message key should be invented for
them** during translation. The equivalents are fixed here so that whenever they
do become translatable the term is already decided:

| English | es-419 | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Buyer's Agent | Agente del comprador | |
| Listing Agent | Agente del vendedor | Do not calque "listing". The English pair was chosen for accuracy about *which party the agent serves*, and naming the party is exactly how Spanish says it. |
| Attorney | Abogado | |
| Transaction Coordinator | Coordinador de transacción | |
| Insurance Agent | Agente de seguros | |
| Title Company | Empresa de títulos | *Empresa*, not *compañía* — consistent with the Company row above. |

**`Co-Client` is deliberately not in that list.** It is the one name that is
*both*: a seeded, tenant-renameable role profile (`co_client` in
`default-role-profiles.ts`) **and** a fixed catalogue string. The public
signature-verification page renders the signer's role from a hardcoded switch
(`app/routes/public/verify.tsx`), so `public_verify_role_co_client` exists and
**is** translated — *Cliente secundario*, per the Co-Client row in the table
above. The two renderings agree, and they must: a tenant who renamed their role
profile sees their own words in the people list (rule 5) and the fixed label on
the verify page. Do not "fix" this by deleting the key.

## Ratings and severity

`Satisfactory`, `Monitor` and `Defect` each appear in five or more module files
(`labels`, `library`, `editor`, `editor-2`, `templates`). They are the single
easiest place to end up with four Spanish words for one concept.

Residential and commercial severity are **separate scales and must never share
vocabulary**: the commercial standard excludes routine maintenance from
"deficiency", which is the opposite of the residential reading.

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Satisfactory | Satisfactorio | — | The top residential tier. |
| Monitor | Vigilar | monitorear | The middle tier. "Monitorear" is a calque and long for a chip. |
| Defect (severity level) | Defecto | — | The bottom residential tier, capitalised as a chip. Same word as the Defect product noun; the two must not drift apart. |
| N/A (severity level) | N/A | — | Left as written. In Spanish *N/A* abbreviates *no aplica* — the same abbreviation with the same expansion, so translating it would only make it longer. |
| Not Inspected | No inspeccionado | — | |
| Not Present | No presente | — | |
| Deficient | Deficiente | — | The commercial/TREC wording. |
| Deficiency | Deficiencia | — | Commercial only. Not a synonym for *defecto*. |
| Hazard | Peligro | — | |
| Functional | Funcional | — | |
| Marginal | Marginal | — | |
| Maintenance | Mantenimiento | — | |

## Status labels

A status word attaches to a different noun in every module: an inspection
(*inspección*, feminine), a report (*informe*, masculine), an invoice
(*factura*, feminine), an agreement (*acuerdo*, masculine), an event
(*evento*, masculine). The same English word therefore cannot both agree with
its subject and stay consistent — and the consistency check forces exactly one
Spanish string per English string. "Published" already labels an inspections tab
*and* two report states in `labels.json` alone.

So **status labels are masculine singular**, agreeing with the implicit
*estado*: "Cancelado", never "Cancelada". This is the only form that scales to
the whole catalogue — it needs no divergence declaration in any module — and it
is what a chip actually means: it names the state, not the thing.

**Prose is different.** A hint that reads "Cancelled inspections" is a sentence,
not a chip, and agrees normally: *Inspecciones canceladas*. The rule above binds
the standalone label only.

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Requested | Solicitado | — | |
| Scheduled (status) | Programado | — | Masculine by the rule above. This is the row that governs the status chip; the Schedule (verb) row governs the verb. |
| Confirmed | Confirmado | — | |
| Completed | Completado | — | |
| Cancelled | Cancelado | — | |
| Active | Activo | — | |
| In Progress | En curso | — | Not *En progreso*, a calque. |
| Submitted | Enviado | — | The report was sent for review; same participle as Send. |
| Published (status) | Publicado | — | |
| Paid | Pagado | — | "Partially paid" → *Pagado parcialmente*. |
| Signed | Firmado | — | |
| Viewed | Visto | — | |
| Declined | Rechazado | — | |
| Expired | Vencido | — | |
| Not sent | No enviado | — | The "Not …" agreement/invoice states all take this shape: *No requerido*, *Sin facturar*, *Sin factura*. |
| Awaiting X | En espera de X | — | "Awaiting payment" → *En espera de pago*; "Awaiting signature" → *En espera de firma*; "Awaiting report" → *En espera del informe*. One shape for the whole family. |
| All (filter / tab) | Todo | — | The uncountable form. The same English "All" labels an inspection filter, an inspection-status tab, a canned-comment tab and a marketplace tab; *Todo* is the only form that agrees with all four and sits correctly beside the singular status labels next to it. *Todos* is deliberately not banned — it is correct in ordinary prose ("a todos los destinatarios"). |

## Recurring UI verbs and states

These are a few hundred keys between them. One word each.

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Save | Guardar | salvar | *Salvar* is to rescue. "Save changes" → "Guardar cambios". |
| Cancel | Cancelar | — | |
| Delete | Eliminar | — | |
| Remove | Quitar | — | Detaching something, not destroying it. Distinct from *Eliminar*. |
| Clear | Borrar | — | Emptying a field. This is why *borrar* is not the word for Delete. |
| Archive | Archivar | — | |
| Publish | Publicar | — | "Published" → *Publicado*. |
| Draft | Borrador | — | The noun. Unrelated to *borrar*. |
| Send | Enviar | — | |
| Resend | Reenviar | — | |
| Download | Descargar | — | |
| Upload | Subir | — | |
| Add | Agregar | añadir | Both are correct Spanish; *agregar* is the region-neutral default and picking one is the point. |

| Loading… | Cargando… | — | Keep the ellipsis character the English string uses. |
| Saving… | Guardando… | — | |
| Sending… | Enviando… | — | |
| Uploading… | Subiendo… | — | |

## The editor and field workflow

Fixed while translating the four `editor*.json` files (595 keys). Several of
these words also appear in `media`, `settings*`, `misc`, `contacts` and
`components`, so they are decided here rather than re-argued there.

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Speed mode | modo rápido | — | The one-item-at-a-time rating flow. Not *modo de velocidad*. |
| Burst camera | cámara en ráfaga | — | *Ráfaga* is the standard photographic term. |
| Snippet | fragmento | — | A saved piece of note text. Distinct from *comentario predefinido*, which is a library entry. |
| Unit (of a multi-unit property) | unidad | — | The per-unit inspection mode. Not the unit of measure — that is *UM* in the cost table. |
| Cost item | elemento de costo | — | A line in the PCA Opinion of Cost. Parallel to *elemento de reparación*. |
| Sign-off | aprobación | — | The commercial reviewer's approval. *Firmar* is the signature act; the sign-off is the recorded approval, and the two appear side by side on the compliance panel. |
| Location | ubicación | — | Where a defect is. Not *localización*. |
| Version history | historial de versiones | — | |
| Restore | Restaurar | — | Bringing back a saved version. Distinct from *Recuperar* (recover one value). |
| Rename | Cambiar nombre | — | Sentence case, no article, because it is a menu item. The aria form takes one: *Cambiar el nombre de {name}*. |
| Cover photo | foto de portada | — | "Set as cover" → *Establecer como portada*. |
| Completion | Avance | — | A percentage stat. *Completitud* is a mathematics word; *avance* is what a progress figure is called. |
| Saved | Guardado | — | The save-state indicator, masculine singular by the status-label rule. |
| Connected / Connecting… | Conectado / Conectando… | — | Collaboration presence. |
| inspector-added | agregado por el inspector | — | The badge on a defect the inspector wrote rather than the library. Lowercase, as in English. |
| Unrated | Sin calificar | — | |
| Batch mode | modo por lotes | — | Multi-select rating. Bulk create is *creación en lote*. |

## Commercial PCA (ASTM E2018)

Commercial report vocabulary. The section numbers are part of the string and
never change; the same headings appear in `editor-4.json` and `pca-report.json`
character for character, so the consistency check binds them together.

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| PCA / PSQ / PCR / EUL / RUL | PCA / PSQ / PCR / EUL / RUL | — | Acronyms of the standard. Left as written — they are how the document names itself, and expanding them in Spanish would not match the report a client receives. |
| Transmittal Letter | Carta de remisión | — | The cover letter ASTM E2018 requires. *Remisión* is the term used for a document formally forwarded to a client. |
| Opinion of Cost | Opinión de Costo | — | The ASTM name for the cost tables. Capitalised because it names a document part. |
| 1.1 General Description | 1.1 Descripción general | — | |
| 1.2 General Physical Condition | 1.2 Condición física general | — | |
| 1.5 Recommendations | 1.5 Recomendaciones | — | See the Repair Items row: this is the legitimate use of the word. |
| 2.1 Purpose | 2.1 Propósito | — | |
| 2.3 Limitations & Exceptions | 2.3 Limitaciones y excepciones | — | |
| 2.4 General Property Reconnaissance | 2.4 Reconocimiento general de la propiedad | — | |
| Additional Considerations | Consideraciones adicionales | — | |
| Immediate / Short-term / Long-term | Inmediato / Corto plazo / Largo plazo | — | The three cost buckets. Masculine singular — they label a bucket, like a status. |
| Conforms / Does not conform | Conforme / No conforme | — | The ASTM conformance statement. |

## The client portal, invoices and verification

Fixed while translating `reports.json` (258 keys) and `pca-report.json` (130).
`reports.json` shares 58 English strings with `checkout`, `inspections`,
`communication`, `booking`, `components`, `misc` and `public` — more overlap
than any other module — so these are the rows the client-facing waves inherit.

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Email / Email address | Correo electrónico | — | The full form both times. *Email* untranslated reads as a loanword the rest of the catalogue avoids, and *correo* alone is postal mail. |
| Phone | Teléfono | — | |
| Property | Propiedad | — | Also the noun in the Product nouns table; repeated here because it is a field label in six modules. |
| Amount | Monto | — | Not *cantidad*, which is a count. "Amount due" → *Monto adeudado*; "Amount paid" → *Monto pagado*. |
| Item | Elemento | — | A row in a list or a table. Same word as a template item — they never collide on one surface. |
| Section | Sección | — | |
| Document | Documento | — | |
| Note | Nota | — | Singular of *notas*. |
| Logo | Logotipo | — | *Logo* is understood but *logotipo* is the written form. |
| Overview | Vista general | — | Deliberately different from Summary → *Resumen*: the client portal shows both, as a nav tab and as a report filter. |
| Sign in (verb) / sign-in link | iniciar sesión / enlace de inicio de sesión | — | "Sign out" → *Cerrar sesión*. Distinct from *Firmar*, which signs a document — English uses "sign" for both and Spanish must not. |
| Please try again. | Inténtelo de nuevo. | — | The recovery sentence on roughly twenty error strings. One wording, *usted* imperative. "Please try again in a moment." → *Inténtelo de nuevo en unos instantes.* |
| Something went wrong | Algo salió mal | — | |
| Copied! | ¡Copiado! | — | Opening exclamation mark is not optional in Spanish. |
| Processing… | Procesando… | — | |
| Secured by Stripe | Protegido por Stripe | — | Not *Asegurado*, which means insured. |
| Privacy Policy | Política de privacidad | — | |
| Repair Request Builder | Generador de solicitudes de reparación | — | The client-facing tool. The document it produces is the *solicitud de reparación*. |
| Condition | Condición | — | The commercial systems-summary column. |
| Compliance | Cumplimiento | — | |
| Not applicable | No aplica | — | Spelled out where English spells it out; *N/A* stays *N/A*. |

## Settings, account and team

Fixed while translating `settings.json` (244 keys). These words are the chrome
of every settings surface and most of them recur in `settings-components`,
`settings-integrations`, `misc`, `nav` and `communication`, so they are decided
once here.

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Settings | Configuración | ajustes | Singular. It is the page name, the breadcrumb and the nav entry; *Ajustes* is the other common rendering and picking one is the point. Only the **plural** is banned: the singular *ajuste* is the ordinary word for an adjustment and is already load-bearing elsewhere (*preajuste de estilo* = style preset), so banning it would false-fire. |
| Account | Cuenta | — | |
| Profile | Perfil | — | |
| Billing | Facturación | — | The area. The document is a *factura*. |
| Integrations | Integraciones | — | |
| Automations | Automatizaciones | — | |
| Communication | Comunicación | — | The settings section covering email and SMS delivery. |
| Advanced | Avanzado | — | Masculine singular: it names a settings section, like a status names a state. |
| Usage | Uso | — | |
| Data | Datos | — | |
| Connected applications | Aplicaciones conectadas | — | The authorized-MCP-client list. |
| Company name | Nombre de la empresa | — | With the article. *Nombre de empresa* reads as a form field on a government paper. |
| Timezone / Your timezone | Zona horaria / Su zona horaria | — | One word in English, two in Spanish; both halves of the pair are fixed so the company and personal settings match. |
| Locale | Configuración regional | — | The language-and-number-format setting. Not *localización*, which is a place. |
| Currency | Moneda | — | |
| Branding | Marca | — | |
| Role / Roles | Rol / Roles | — | The account role. *Rol* is the region-neutral form; *papel* is a theatre part. |
| Export (settings action) | Exportar | — | Infinitive, matching the sibling *Importar contactos*. Used for the heading and the button alike. |
| Import | Importar | — | |
| GDPR | RGPD | — | The regulation's own Spanish acronym. Used in the Data and Compliance sections. |
| Not set | Sin definir | — | The empty-value rendering of any account field. Invariant for gender, which is why it is not *No definido*. |
| Pending | Pendiente | — | Invite and member state. Invariant for gender, so the status-label rule needs no help here. |
| Signature | Firma | — | The drawn/uploaded mark. The email footer is the *firma de correo electrónico*; both are *firma* and they never share a surface. |
| Saved. | Guardado. | — | The flash message, masculine singular by the status-label rule. |
| Couldn't save that. Please try again. | No se pudo guardar. Inténtelo de nuevo. | — | Built from the two fixed halves: the impersonal failure and the one recovery sentence. |
| Unknown action | Acción desconocida | — | The form-action fallback error, shared by several settings routes. |
| Free plan limit reached | Límite del plan gratuito alcanzado | — | |

### The services / event-types catalogue

Fixed while translating `settings-catalog.json` (123 keys). These recur in
`settings-components`, `contacts` and `public`.

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Slug | Identificador | — | The URL-safe key of an event type or a booking page. *Slug* is untranslatable jargon in Spanish and the column shows values like `radon_pickup`, which explain themselves. The placeholder that shows that value stays English — it is a format sample. |
| Duration | Duración | — | |
| Platform | Plataforma | — | The vendor-shipped tier of inspection types, against *Su organización*. |
| Enabled / Disabled | Habilitado / Deshabilitado | — | Paired with the verbs *Habilitar* / *Deshabilitar* so the chip and the button that flips it share a root. |
| Inactive | Inactivo | — | Masculine singular by the status-label rule. |
| My Schedule | Mi agenda | — | Uses the Schedule (noun) row: *agenda*, not *horario*, which is the weekly-hours grid inside it. |
| No access / View only / View and edit | Sin acceso / Solo lectura / Ver y editar | — | The three capability levels, shared by the workflow settings and the contact-role modal. *Solo lectura* is the recognised access level; the third stays a verb pair because English does. |
| Sort order | Orden de clasificación | — | |
| Report link expiry | Vencimiento del enlace del informe | — | *Vencimiento*, matching Expired → *Vencido*. The bulk actions are phrased as *Aplicar vencimiento a…* / *Quitar vencimiento de…*: Spanish *vencer* is intransitive, so "Expire N links" has no verb-for-verb rendering. |

### Scheduling, providers and integration panels

Fixed while translating `settings-components.json` (491 keys), the largest
module in the catalogue. It is where the product talks to Google, Stripe,
Twilio, Telnyx and four email vendors, so it also fixes how third-party text is
handled.

**Rule 7 applies heavily here, and extends to third-party navigation.** A menu
path into someone else's product (`Stripe → Developers → Webhooks`,
`Twilio Console → Account Info`, `Account → Customer subdomain`), the label of a
button the user must click *in that product* (`Send test event`), a credential
field name (`Twilio Account SID`, `Auth Token`), a key prefix (`pk_test_`,
`whsec_`, `SG.`), a format sample (`+15551234567`, `acct_1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnO`,
`customer.cloudflarestream.com`) and the SMS keywords carriers match on
(**STOP / START / HELP**) all stay English. Translate the prose around them. The
STOP/HELP case is not cosmetic: those are the words a consumer texts back, and a
translated one would be a compliance failure, not a typo. The individual strings
named in this paragraph are enforced from the "Literals that must survive
translation" table near the top of this file — add a row there when you add one
here, or the sentence is the only thing holding the line.

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Holiday | feriado | festivo | *Festivo* is Castilian; `es-419` says *feriado*. "Company holidays" → *Feriados de la empresa*. |
| Time off | Ausencias | — | Plural, because the panel lists blocks. *Tiempo libre* is leisure, not a scheduled absence. |
| Tenant (the SaaS account) | cuenta | — | Deliberately **not** *inquilino*. In a product whose subject is somebody's house, *inquilino* is the person renting it — the same collision the Owner row avoids. Not machine-banned: a future English string about an actual occupant would need the word. |
| Failed (a test / a delivery) | Fallido | — | Masculine singular by the status-label rule; the verb *Falló* is used in sentences (*Falló la sincronización del calendario.*). |
| Not connected / Not configured | Sin conectar / Sin configurar | — | The *Sin …* shape, matching *Sin definir*. Reserve *No …* for sentences. |
| Qualified (inspectors) | autorizados | — | Not *calificados*: this catalogue already spends *calificación* on Rating, and "inspectores calificados" reads as *rated* inspectors to anyone who has seen the editor. *Autorizados* also states what the checkbox does — the help text below it says "allow all staff". |
| Light / Dark (theme) | Claro / Oscuro | — | |
| Live / Test (Stripe key mode) | Producción / Prueba | — | |
| Carrier | operador | — | The mobile carrier. |
| Concierge review | revisión previa | conserjería | *Conserjería* is a doorman's desk. The English is internal jargon for "the office approves it first", which is what the Spanish says. |
| Slot | horario | — | A bookable start time. "Slot rules" → *Reglas de horarios*, "Slot interval" → *Intervalo entre horarios*. |
| Weekday names | Domingo … Sábado | — | Capitalised, because each is a standalone row label and buttons/labels take sentence case. Spanish lowercases weekdays mid-sentence; nothing in this catalogue puts one mid-sentence. |

### Communication, billing and compliance settings

Fixed while translating `settings-integrations.json` (294 keys).

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Subject (email) | Asunto | — | The subject line. Distinct from the GDPR data subject — see the declared divergence. |
| Data subject | Interesado | — | The GDPR term for the person a record is about. The regulation's own Spanish text uses *interesado*. |
| Seat | puesto | — | A licensed team member. Never *asiento*: that is a chair, an *asiento contable* is a ledger entry, and in this product's own domain *asiento* is foundation settlement. Deliberately not machine-banned for exactly that last reason. |
| Managed (SMS, provider, number) | gestionado | — | Run by the platform on the tenant's behalf. |
| Self-hosted | autoalojado | — | "Self-host docs" → *Documentación de autoalojamiento*. |
| Standalone mode | modo autónomo | — | The single-tenant deployment. |
| Deployment | instalación | despliegue | *Despliegue* is a military deployment; an operator reads *instalación*. |
| Opt-in / opt-out | consentimiento / baja | — | SMS compliance. The keywords themselves (STOP / START / HELP) stay English. |
| Erasure request | solicitud de eliminación | — | GDPR Art. 17. Uses *eliminar*, the Delete verb. |
| Anonymized / Retained | Anonimizado / Conservado | — | Erasure-log columns, masculine singular alongside *Eliminado*. |
| Built-in | Integrado | — | A platform-supplied template or referral source, against the tenant's own. |
| Estimated monthly cost | Costo mensual estimado | — | The one place *estimado* is the right word — see the Estimate row, which bans the noun and not this adjective. The figure itself is *un cálculo aproximado*, never *un estimado*. |

### Authentication

Fixed while finishing `auth.json` (126 keys beyond the 15-key login pilot). This
module is almost entirely imperatives, which is where the register decision is
either kept or quietly lost — the gate catches *tus*, it does not catch
*Ingresa*.

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Log in / Sign in | Iniciar sesión | loguearse, iniciar la sesión | English uses both verbs for one act; Spanish has one. "Log In" and "Sign in" therefore land on the same string, and "Back to log in" / "Back to sign in" both become *Volver al inicio de sesión* — the destination is the page, not the act. Still distinct from *Firmar*, which signs a document. |
| Reset (a password) | Restablecer | resetear | *Resetear* is an anglicism. "Reset link" → *enlace de restablecimiento*. |
| Setup (first-run) | Configuración inicial | — | Distinguished from Settings → *Configuración*, which is the ongoing page. The `SETUP_CODE` secret name and the Cloudflare dashboard path beside it stay English. |
| Sign up | Registrarse | — | Creating an account. Distinct from *Iniciar sesión*. |
| Partner agent | agente asociado | — | The agent-portal relationship. |
| Referral (an agent's) | referencia | — | Also *Fuentes de referencia* in company settings; one root for both. |
| You have been invited | Usted recibió una invitación | — | The passive shape avoids *Ha sido invitado/invitada*: the catalogue cannot know the reader's gender, and every second-person sentence in `auth` has to survive that. Prefer a construction with no participle agreeing with the reader. |

## Register enforcement

Every entry here is wrong in `es-419` in every context, which is what makes it
safe to ban outright. Soft preferences belong in the "Why" column of the tables
above, not in this one.

The columns are the same four as every other table, so the gate reads it the
same way — headers are bound by name, and a table calling them anything else is
treated as a different table and rejected. The only oddity is that the first
column holds a grammatical category ("Possessive, 2nd person") rather than an
English word for half the rows. That is what the English side *is* for a
register rule; the column still means "the thing being fixed".

<!-- gate:terms -->

| English | es-419 | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Possessive, 2nd person | su / sus | tu, tus | *tú* register. Both accented and unaccented forms are caught. |
| Subject pronoun, 2nd person | usted | tú, ti, contigo, tuyo, tuya | |
| Clitic, 2nd person | le / lo / la | te | *te* is the *tú* clitic; *usted* takes *le*. |
| Abbreviated courtesy | usted | Ud., Vd. | Write it out. |
| 2nd person plural | ustedes | vosotros, vuestro, vuestra | Castilian only; wrong everywhere in `es-419`. |
| Computer | computadora | ordenador | Castilian. |
| File | archivo | fichero | Castilian. |
| To take / get | tomar, obtener | coger | Vulgar in most of Latin America. |

## Consistency across modules

Two keys whose **English is character-for-character identical** must have
identical Spanish. This is checked automatically and is the rule that stops
"Satisfactory" becoming *Satisfactorio* in `labels.json` and *Aceptable* in
`library.json`.

Where the same English genuinely needs two Spanish renderings — usually gender
agreement, or a word that is a noun in one place and a verb in another — list
the keys here with the reason, and the gate will allow it.

**Put every key sharing that English on the bullet's first line.** The parser
reads keys only from lines that begin with `-`, so keys wrapped onto a
continuation line are dropped, and a divergence missing one of its keys does not
apply at all.

<!-- gate:divergence -->

- `settings_team_resend_invite`, `settings_integrations_resend_name`, `settings_email_provider_resend`, `comm_action_resend` — English "Resend" is two unrelated things.
  On the team page and in the communication outbox it is the verb (send it
  again) and must be *Reenviar*. In the integrations catalogue and the
  email-provider select it is
  **Resend the company**, the transactional email vendor, and rule 3 forbids
  translating a product name — *Reenviar* there would name a provider that does
  not exist. The two readings never share a surface.

- `settings_comms_template_subject_label`, `settings_compliance_col_subject` — English "Subject" is a homograph, not a shared concept. On the email-template editor it is the subject line (*Asunto*); in the erasure log it is the GDPR **data subject**, a person (*Interesado*). No Spanish word covers both, and picking either would make one of the two screens nonsense.

- `checkout_step_pay`, `metrics_col_pay` — English "Pay" is a verb in one place and a noun in the other. On the client checkout it is the step that takes the payment, an instruction to the reader (*Pagar*). In the per-inspector metrics table it is a column header naming the money an inspector earned on the work (*Pago*) — the amount, not an action. *Pagar* as a column header reads as a command to pay the inspector, and *Pago* on the checkout button stops asking the client to do anything. The header is deliberately "Pay" and not "Cost": the inspector sees this column, and naming their earnings a cost is the company's view of them, not theirs.

- `auth_agent_invite_prop3_title`, `media_cropper_free` — English "Free" is price in one place and shape in the other. On the agent-portal invite it is the cost of the account (*Gratis*); in the photo cropper it is the unconstrained aspect ratio beside Portrait and Landscape (*Libre*). *Gratis* on a crop button says the crop costs nothing, which is not a thing anyone was wondering.

- `schedule_heatmap_open`, `imports_open` — English "Open" is an adjective in one place and a verb in the other. On the schedule heatmap it describes a slot with nothing booked in it (*Disponible*); in the imports table it is the action that opens one import run (*Abrir*). *Abrir* on the heatmap turns a description of availability into a command, and *Disponible* in a table's action column stops being a link at all.

*(Add further divergences as `- \`key_one\`, \`key_two\` — reason.)*

## Working through a module

1. Read the English values, not the key names.
2. Apply the tables above. If a term recurs and is not in a table, add a row
   here first — that is cheaper than finding three spellings later.
3. Keep every placeholder.
4. `npm run i18n:compile` once for the whole module, not per key.
5. `npm run lint:i18n-glossary` and `npm run lint:i18n-catalog`.

### Known deviation

The 15 keys in `messages/es-419/auth.json` were written during the login pilot,
before this glossary existed, in the *tú* register. They were re-registered to
*usted* when this file landed. If any pre-glossary Spanish is found elsewhere,
fix the register rather than widening the gate.
