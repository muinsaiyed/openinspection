 * Not the coordinates. A person read the form and signed for those, and no test
 * can re-do that. What is checkable is that the software carries what they
 * signed WITHOUT ALTERATION, and that the surrounding declarations tell the
 * truth about it — which is exactly the half that goes wrong quietly.
