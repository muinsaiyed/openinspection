/**
 * Statutory form versions, and choosing one by the INSPECTION date.
 *
 * A statutory form is not a template. It is an authority's own published PDF,
 * and the question this file answers is the only one that can be answered in
 * code without reading the form: WHICH REVISION applies to an inspection.
 *
 * ── Why the inspection date and not "the current one" ───────────────────────
 * A report is routinely produced days or weeks after the inspection it
 * describes, and an authority may keep a superseded revision valid long after
 * publishing its replacement. Selecting by "latest" therefore renders a
 * document the inspection was not performed against — silently, because both
 * documents look official. Selection is by inspection date, always.
 *
 * ── Two functions, because there are two questions ──────────────────────────
 * A revision may be publishable months before it is mandatory. Inside that
 * window BOTH revisions are usable and the choice belongs to the inspector, so:
 *
 *   `selectableVersions()` — every revision usable for that date, oldest first.
 *   `versionForInspection()` — the DEFAULT: the revision that is mandatory on
 *                             that date.
 *
 * Collapsing them into one function is how the choice disappears. The default
 * never drifts to a newer, not-yet-mandatory revision on its own: adopting one
 * early is a decision, and a registry that made it silently would be
 * substituting one statutory document for another.
 *
 * ── Only a PUBLISHED revision is ever selected ──────────────────────────────
 * Both functions admit a row only if it carries the marks of a publication
 * decision — see `isPublishedVersion`. A scheduled watcher detects that an
 * authority changed its form (`revision-watch.ts`); what it learns is a page, a
 * digest and a date it looked, and none of that is an effective date or a
 * publisher. So a row assembled from a detection is refused here rather than
 * quietly selected, and detection can never become adoption by someone copying
 * fields across.
 *
 * ── This file holds no PDF bytes and no field map ───────────────────────────
 * A version identifies bytes by `sourceHash`; where those bytes live is object
 * storage, recorded on the `statutory_form_versions` row. The map from our
 * fields onto that PDF is `field-map.ts`, and it is bound to a single
 * `sourceHash` because it may never be inherited across revisions.
 */

/**
 * WHY a revision stopped being produceable. Two causes, and they are not two
 * spellings of one thing — they demand opposite next steps from a workspace:
 *
 *   `field_map_incorrect` — OUR fault. The map that decides which box each
 *       answer prints in was found wrong, so documents already produced from
 *       this revision may say something other than what was inspected. A
 *       corrected map is coming, in a software update, and the documents
 *       already issued may have to be issued again once it lands. The workspace
 *       WAITS for us.
 *   `authority_withdrew` — the publisher's decision. The document itself is no
 *       longer the one to file. Nothing we ship will bring it back, so there is
 *       nothing to wait for: the workspace moves to whichever revision is now
 *       in force. The workspace ACTS, now.
 *
 * One word for both ("withdrawn") is a word that tells nobody which of those to
 * do, which is why every surface that reports a withdrawal reports the reason
 * with it.

 * reason, and a reason on a revision that is still live — and neither is a
 * compile error, so both become a runtime check somebody has to remember to
 * write and every reader has to remember to trust. Nested, the pairing is not
 * expressible wrongly: the date and the reason arrive together or neither does,
 * and no validation is needed because there is no invalid value to validate.
