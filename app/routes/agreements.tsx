/**
 * Library → Agreements. Reusable agreement TEMPLATES, and nothing else.
 *
 * IA-65 — this page used to carry a second "Signing" tab listing every live
 * signing request in the tenant, with the remind / copy-link / pre-sign actions
 * on it. A signing request is not a library asset: it belongs to one
 * inspection, has a state, and someone is waiting on it. Chasing one meant
 * leaving that inspection to find it again in a tenant-wide table. Those live
 * envelopes now render on the inspection itself (`SigningRequests` in the
 * workspace); the Library keeps what is genuinely reusable.
 *
 * #67 — the page was READ-ONLY, and not by design. "+ New agreement" was a
 * `<Button variant="primary">` with no `onClick`, and the per-row "Edit" was a
 * bare `<button>` with none either, while `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE /agreements`
 * had been sitting on the server unused the whole time. Authoring lives in
 * `AgreementTemplateModal`; the writes go through
 * `/resources/agreement-templates`, because a client `fetch('/api/...')` in
 * this repository carries no JWT.

/**
 * #84 — the list is read WITH the cancellation-clause attestation.
 *
 * Deleting the template a live attestation names revokes it, and the delete
 * dialog has to be able to say so before the button is pressed. The id comes
 * from the branding endpoint's `cancellationClause`, computed server-side by
 * `getCancellationAttestation()` — the same function the fee gate reads. It is
 * never derived here from the raw columns: a second copy of the invalidation
 * rule is a copy that ends up disagreeing with the refusal.
 *
 * ⚠️ A failed branding read fails the whole load, exactly as a failed template
 * list does. Rendering the page with `attestedAgreementId: null` because a read
 * failed would offer a delete button under the wrong dialog — the silent
 * revocation this page is supposed to stop. `LoadFailedNotice` says so.
