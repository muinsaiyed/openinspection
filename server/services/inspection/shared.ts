/**
 * An inspection's own frozen structure — the ONE way to read it.
 *
 * ─── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Four consumers used to fall back to the LIVE `templates.schema` when an
 * inspection had no snapshot, each with its own spelling of the same check.
 * That made the snapshot a convention rather than a guarantee: the next row
 * that missed one silently re-acquired today's template structure and nothing
 * failed. It is the `trade_slug` shape — the mechanism was correct and nothing
 * stopped it being bypassed. A report re-derived that way is not the report the
 * inspector filled in, and there is no signal that it happened.
 *
 * ─── The two ways callers use it, and why they differ ───────────────────────
 * ⚠️ Four callers, two behaviours. Do NOT make them uniform without re-reading
 * this: they are answering different questions.
 *
 *   THROW — `requireTemplateSnapshot`
 *     `inspection-report.service.ts` and `inspection-publish.service.ts`.
 *     They answer "what does this report contain" and "may it be published".
 *     A wrong answer there reaches a client, so a missing snapshot is a 500
 *     (`Errors.Internal`, server/lib/errors.ts) rather than a plausible
 *     document nobody can vouch for. Not a 404 and not a 409: the caller did
 *     nothing wrong, an invariant of ours was violated. The report page's error
 *     boundary shows the failure and the structured log carries the id.
 *
 *   LOG AND DEGRADE — `templateSnapshotSectionsOrNone`
 *     `inspection-photo.service.ts` and the admin bulk-import path. Both build
 *     an item-id → label map and already degrade to using the item id as its
 *     own label. Making them throw would turn a cosmetic degradation into a
 *     broken drawer. Silence is what is forbidden here, not the degradation —
 *     so they log and STOP reading the live template.
 *
 * See #307.
