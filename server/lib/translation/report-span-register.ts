/**
 * #23 — the classification the segmenter reads.
 *
 * A report payload is a tree of VALUES. The non-translatable registry
 * (`server/lib/legal/non-translatable-manifest.ts`) is a register of KINDS.
 * This module is the join between them: every top-level key the report payload
 * carries, answered with one of three dispositions and a reason.
 *
 * ## Why an enumeration of PERMITTED keys, and never a filter
 *
 * A filter is a deny-list. A deny-list written against a payload shape re-opens
 * silently the moment the payload grows a field, and nothing downstream would
 * notice: the response invariant at the model seam checks segment COUNT, which
 * a widened segment list satisfies perfectly.
 *
 * This is not a hypothetical. The assembled reliance block reaches the payload
 * as `relianceText`. It appeared on no exclusion list anywhere in the tree, and
 * no code path would have kept it out of a translation request. That is the
 * whole argument for the shape of this file: a key with no entry FAILS the
 * totality test rather than defaulting in either direction, so the next field
 * added to the payload cannot become eligible by being forgotten.
 *
 * ## The three dispositions
 *
 * - `convenience_translation` — machine translation is permitted, and what it
 *   produces is delivered under a notice saying the English is the record. It
 *   is never authoritative.
 * - `authoritative_english` — the text IS the instrument, or is evidence of
 *   one. It stays English wherever it is rendered, including inside a
 *   translated deliverable, and that must look deliberate rather than like an
 *   untranslated remnant.
 * - `not_text` — there is no prose here to translate: identifiers, numbers,
 *   dates, enum values, colours, URLs, and vocabularies looked up by id.
 *
 * ## A key-level answer is not enough, so there is a leaf enumeration too
 *
 * `sections` is permitted, and a per-section `disclaimerText` sits three levels
 * inside it — registered instrument text that a key-level answer would have
 * shipped straight to a model. So the fields that may be READ out of a
 * permitted key are enumerated as well, in `PERMITTED_LEAF_FIELDS`, and the
 * segmenter reads nothing else.
 *
 * ⚠️ When in doubt, a key is NOT permitted. Widening is a small, reviewable
 * edit to one entry; narrowing after something has been sent to a provider is
 * not an edit at all.
