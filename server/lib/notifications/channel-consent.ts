 * - a STAFF member or AGENT is RESUMING. They were reachable under an existing

 *   disclosure to show and nothing to acknowledge — the row withdraws their
 *   earlier stop.
 *
 * An earlier version refused the second case outright, on the reasoning that a
 * staff `granted` row pollutes consumer evidence. That was too blunt: it built
 * a one-way door, and a staff member who stopped could never start again. The
 * separation belongs in the column, not in the absence of the row — a filing
 * that counts opt-in evidence filters `recipient_type = 'client'`, which is
