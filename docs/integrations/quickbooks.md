# QuickBooks Online — connecting a self-hosted deployment

OpenInspection pushes customers, invoices and refunds to QuickBooks Online, and reads invoice payment status back. A self-hosted deployment connects through **its own Intuit app**, which you create once on Intuit's developer portal.

That is not a limitation of this build. Intuit matches an OAuth redirect URI **byte for byte** against the app it was registered on, and your deployment answers on your own domain — so no app but yours can complete the handshake against it.

---

## What you need

Four settings. Three are credentials from your Intuit app; the fourth says which Intuit environment that app belongs to.

| Setting | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| `QBO_CLIENT_ID` | Intuit app → Keys & credentials |
| `QBO_CLIENT_SECRET` | the same page |
| `QBO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Intuit app → Webhooks → verifier token |
| `QBO_ENV` | `sandbox` or `production` — see below |

Set them either as Worker secrets (`wrangler secret put`) or in the app under **Settings → Integrations → QuickBooks Online**. **The Worker environment wins**; a stored value is the fallback, which is what makes the settings form useful on a deployment you cannot easily redeploy.

`APP_BASE_URL` must also be set, and must be the exact public origin your deployment answers on. It is what the redirect URI is built from.

### `QBO_ENV` is not optional and has no default

`sandbox` reaches `sandbox-quickbooks.api.intuit.com`; `production` reaches `quickbooks.api.intuit.com`. There is deliberately no default: a Development key authenticates only against sandbox companies and a Production key only against real ones, so a guessed host is wrong for one of them and fails in a way that reads like a bad credential.

If it is unset, the connect flow stops and the settings page says so explicitly rather than reporting a credential problem.

## Creating the Intuit app

1. Sign in at `developer.intuit.com` and create an app with the **com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting** scope.
2. Under **Keys & credentials**, copy the Client ID and Client Secret. Development keys are issued immediately; Production keys require Intuit's app assessment.
3. Register the **redirect URI** exactly:

   ```
   https://<your-domain>/api/integrations/qbo/callback
   ```

   It must be `https`. Intuit's console rejects `http://localhost` outright, so a plain local port cannot be registered — use a tunnel with an https origin if you need to test locally.

4. Register the **Disconnect URL**:

   ```
   https://<your-domain>/integrations/quickbooks/disconnected
   ```

   Intuit sends a user here after they disconnect your app from the QuickBooks side. The page is public and static by necessity: that redirect is a cross-site navigation and carries none of your session cookies.

5. Under **Webhooks**, register the endpoint and copy the verifier token:

   ```
   https://<your-domain>/webhooks/quickbooks
   ```

   This is a **different path** from the redirect URI. Putting the callback URL in the webhook field is a common mix-up and produces an `invalid redirect_uri` error at authorize time, because the redirect URI was then never registered at all.

## Connecting

**Settings → Integrations → QuickBooks Online → Connect to QuickBooks.** After authorizing, the connect button is replaced by the connected company and a **Disconnect from QuickBooks** control.

Every outcome of the handshake is reported on that page, including the failures — a missing credential, an unset `QBO_ENV`, an expired attempt, or a declined authorization.

### One QuickBooks company, one workspace

A QuickBooks company (its *realm*) can be connected to exactly one workspace. Connecting one that another workspace already holds is refused, and the page says so: disconnect it there first.

The reason is the webhook. It is a single unauthenticated endpoint shared by every connection — the path carries no workspace — so after verifying the Intuit signature the only thing that says whose books an event belongs to is the realm id inside the verified payload. Two workspaces claiming the same realm would make that answer ambiguous, and an ambiguous answer would post one company's payments into whichever workspace happened to be found first. Rather than guess, such an event is skipped and logged with both claimants named.

## What happens when a connection ends

Two things end a connection, and both leave the same state behind: no connection, no entity mappings, no open sync errors.

- **You disconnect**, from this app or from QuickBooks.
- **Intuit refuses the grant.** Access tokens last an hour and are refreshed automatically; the refresh token rotates on every refresh and is re-stored each time. If Intuit answers a refresh with `400` or `401`, the grant is genuinely gone and the connection is retired.

Any other refresh failure — a 5xx, a rate limit, a network error — leaves the connection intact, because none of those say anything about your token.

Mappings are cleared on purpose. Reconnecting can land on a **different** QuickBooks company, and a mapping that outlived its connection would still name entity ids belonging to the old one.

## Limits worth knowing

- QuickBooks **Online** only. The REST API this integration uses does not cover QuickBooks Desktop or Self-Employed.
- Intuit throttles per app **and** company: 500 requests per minute per company, and at most 10 concurrent requests to the same company.
- Two things are read back FROM QuickBooks: payment status, and whether an invoice was voided there. Everything else flows one way, out of OpenInspection.
- A void in QuickBooks is **recorded, not mirrored**. OpenInspection files it under Sync Errors and leaves the invoice as it was, because voiding here resets the inspection's payment gate and can retract a published report — a decision, not something a poll should make for you. If the void was intended, void it here too.
- QuickBooks rejects a colon in a customer's name, so the name sent over is the contact's with any colons removed. The contact's record here is unchanged.
