/**
 * An intake run holds third-party personal data — the operator's clients' names,
 * email addresses and phone numbers — in a staging row and in an object nothing
 * else points at. So it expires, and the expiry is enforced rather than
 * declared.
 *
 * Two lifetimes, one rule. A run the operator staged and left goes after thirty
 * days; a run waiting on a person goes after ninety. The catalogue states the
 * outer bound because a table gets one rule; the per-batch column is what the
 * sweep compares, and the executor reads it.
 *
 * Object first, entries second, key last. The batch row is the only thing that
 * knows the object's key, so clearing the key first leaves an object nothing
 * can ever reach.
 *
 * The batch row itself SURVIVES: ids, timestamps, a vendor name, this
 * workspace's own authorisations, and the bundle manifest. ⚠️ This said the row
 * "carries no third-party data" and that was not accurate — a template adapter
 * writes warnings quoting a canned comment's name and up to forty characters of
 * its body, and those live in the manifest and are never cleared. The action
 * stays `erase_in_place` on those facts — a canned-comment title is the
 * operator's own template content — but a low assessed exposure never made the
 * wrong description right.
 *
 * Which status a cleared run lands on, and why the answer differs per run,
 * lives in `tests/unit/migration-intake/batch-terminal-states.spec.ts`.
 *
 * That the run cannot outlive its own upload past the declared window, on any
 * path including a late apply, is held by `migration-intake-outer-bound.spec.ts`.
