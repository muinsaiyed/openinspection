 * shape below is two SECTIONS rather than one list of toggles — and why the
 * always-sent group is a section with a reason instead of a row of disabled
 * switches. A greyed-out toggle invites the reader to try, then tells them no.
 *
 * Three surfaces render this (staff, agent, client) and they must not each
 * decide what belongs on it. The filtering rules — audience, recipient-facing,
 * which channels a class can even use — live here once, so a class added later
 * appears in all three or none.

/**
 * EVERY CLASS SHOWS EVERY CHANNEL, and the screen reads neither the class's
 * own `channels` list nor the tenant's automation rules and templates.
 *
 * A preference is a statement of INTENT — "do not text me about bookings" — and
 * that sentence is true and worth storing before anyone has written the text.
 * When the content and the rule are completed the stored answer simply takes
 * effect, with no screen that changed shape underneath the reader and no
 * decision silently lost in between.
 *
 * The asymmetry is what makes this safe: the switch's meaningful direction is
 * OFF, and OFF always works. A channel left ON that nothing sends yet is not a
 * broken promise, it is just quiet.
 *
 * `classes.ts`'s `channels` is still the truth about what the CODE can send and
 * still gates the send path; it just no longer decides what the screen offers.
 *
 * @param chosen  `${classId}:${channel}` → the explicit choice this subject
 *                stored, for the rows they actually hold. A class with NO entry
 *                falls back to its own default, which is usually "send" but is
 *                not always — see `defaultEnabled`. Only differences from the
 *                default are stored, so this map stays small (§3.2).
