 * #275 — the repair-vs-replace action tag on a repair-request line item, and
 * the single predicate that decides who may author one.
 *
 * A LEAF module on purpose. The drizzle column, the request schema, the service
 * and the route all read the same vocabulary from here, so the four cannot
 * disagree; and because this file's only import is another leaf (`people/role-kinds`,
 * which in turn imports only `auth/roles`), the UI can read the predicate
 * without dragging `drizzle-orm/d1` into the client bundle — the shape
 * `app/lib/people/agent-repair-access.ts` already establishes for the agent
 * repair policy. Keep it that way: anything with a runtime dependency belongs
 * on the other side of this module, not in it.

 * would be a professional scope recommendation shipped inside a document the
 * buyer negotiates with — the capability the repair-cost boundary rules out.
 *
 * ⚠️ This refuses the FIELD, never the request. An inspector on owner-preview
 * legitimately creates lists and adds items today (`repair-access.ts` resolves
 * that JWT to `kind: 'inspector'`, `accessLevel: 'readwrite'`), so a tag-less
 * write from an inspector stays legal. Enforced in `repair-gates.ts` and read
 * by the UI, so no page can offer an action the API refuses.
