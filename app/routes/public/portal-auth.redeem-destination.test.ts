/**
 * Where a redeemed magic-link lands — and, for an agent, where it must NOT.
 *
 * Adding `?to=notifications` gave the redemption a second destination, and the
 * cheap way to write that is a ternary on the path. This spec exists because
 * one of the four answers is not a routing preference: an agent-resolved redeem
 * holds `__Host-inspector_token` and NO `__Host-portal_session`, so a `/portal/`
 * path handed to an agent is the exact confusion the agent branch was built to
 * prevent (server/api/portal.ts redeemRoute).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE FILENAME IS LOAD-BEARING, and it is not a style preference. This was
 * `portal-auth.test.tsx`, sitting beside `portal-auth.test.ts`. TypeScript's
 * `include` expansion resolves a directory entry by base path and keeps ONE
 * extension per base — `.ts` outranks `.tsx` — so the `.tsx` twin was silently
 * dropped from the program and type-checked by nothing. vitest collected and
 * ran it, so it looked covered. eslint's type-aware parser was the only thing
 * that ever said so, with "file not found in any of the provided project(s)".
 *
 * `scripts/check-tests-tsconfig.mjs` could not catch it either: that gate
 * compares tsconfig.json's `exclude` array against a baseline, and this file
 * was never excluded by anything — it lost a name collision. A gate that checks
 * a declaration cannot see an object that declares nothing.
 *
 * Do not rename this back to `<something>.test.tsx` while a `<something>.test.ts`
 * exists next to it.
