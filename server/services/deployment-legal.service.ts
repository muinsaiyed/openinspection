/**
 * The deployment's own legal documents — the ones with no tenant behind them.
 *
 * `LegalVersionService` beside this file answers the same questions for a
 * TENANT's Privacy and Terms. The split is the counterparty, not the mechanism:
 * an agent account is global (`users.tenant_id IS NULL`) and spans every company
 * on the deployment that names it, so the party on the other side of the agent
 * terms is whoever operates the software. There is one such document, not one per
 * company, and there is no tenant to key it on.
 *
 * Keeping it here also removes a mode branch rather than adding one. The previous
 * read went through `profile.fixedTenantId`, which exists in standalone (the
 * single tenant IS the operator) and is null in SaaS — so agent signup refused
 * every SaaS request. This service answers both modes with one query.
