 * The one rule about putting somebody else's file in front of an outside

 *
 * The two ends are different questions and neither implies the other:
 *   - WHO may decide it (`assertStaffAccessDecisionIsOwners`), asked at the
 *     moment the run is opened, before anything is stored;
 *   - WHETHER that decision was ever recorded (`assertStaffAccessAuthorized`),
 *     asked again every time somebody acts on the file afterwards.
 *
 * They live together because they are the same policy, and because they were
 * previously apart: the role half existed only on the intent that names
 * assistance outright, so the same run reached through the unreadable-file
 * fallback was opened by whoever could import contacts.
 */

/**
 * Whether this actor may decide to have a person open somebody else's file.
 *
 * An owner's call, and NOT the same question as who may run an import. The
 * intent gate answers the second one — a manager may import contacts — and a
 * file no adapter can read turns that import into this decision partway
 * through, which is why the check cannot live on the intent alone.

/**
 * Whether anything authorises using an uploaded file's CONTENTS for anything
 * beyond the one run it was uploaded for.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS ALWAYS FALSE, and that is a property of this deployment rather than
 * of any particular run. Two authorisations are asked for and recorded on a
 * batch — keeping the file (A), and a person opening it to convert it (B) —
 * and there is no third. No column can carry a yes, so no run can produce one.
 *
 * It is a function taking the run, and it is on the wire, for two separate
 * reasons that are worth keeping apart:
 *
 *   - The operator console must SHOW this state per run. A screen that simply
 *     omits it would leave "may this file be used for anything else" as
 *     something each person has to remember; showing "no" on every row is the
 *     rule made visible at the moment somebody could break it.
 *   - If a deployment ever adds a third authorisation, the answer starts
 *     varying per run. The wire field and this signature are already shaped for
 *     that; a hardcoded `false` at the emit site would have to be found first.
 *
 * The parameter is deliberately unused TODAY. Anyone adding a third
 * authorisation reads this comment on their way to using it.

 *
 * This cannot prevent a file from having been opened — that happens in object
