/**
 * Track I-a GDPR (spec §5) — the erasure manifest. A schema-annotated catalogue
 * of PII columns and the action to take on a data-subject erasure request,
 * adopting the Fides *pattern* (data categories + masking strategy + decision
 * log) hand-rolled for single-Worker + D1 with zero external SaaS.
 *
 * One entry per PII column. The orchestrator (G2) walks these rules, decides per
 * rule + row-state, executes, and writes one `erasure_log` decision row.
 *
 * G2 fills `ERASURE_MANIFEST`; this scaffold (G1) ships the type + an empty array.
 *
 * ⚠️ HOW MUCH WEIGHT THIS FILE'S PROSE CAN CARRY. On 2026-08-07 two separate
 * justifications in here were checked against the code and found FALSE: the
 * `reports.title` rule claimed a column "a human writes" that is in fact
 * system-written with no API that can edit it (corrected below, with an
 * amendment history rather than a silent overwrite), and `repair_requests.
 * created_by_ref` was documented as an opaque id while the code stores an email
 * address in it — a compliance classification resting on a comment that had been
 * wrong for as long as the feature existed. Both rules survived review because
 * their reasoning read well. A premise stated in a comment is not evidence:
 * before you rely on one of these paragraphs, go read what writes the column.
 *
 * Executor: `erasure-orchestrator.ts` — the concrete Drizzle executor that
 * realizes these rules. Binding verified by
 * `tests/unit/privacy/erasure-manifest-coverage.spec.ts` (drift guard).

    // pushes you toward, which is why it was not ours to decide alone.
    //
    // RETAINED under Art. 17(3)(e) instead: the address identifies which
    // property a report describes, and the report is the inspector's defence
    // against a negligence claim. One entry per column, no wildcard — an auditor
    // reads this file, and a wildcard hides what was actually considered.
    //
    // Retained means FOR A PERIOD. The bound is the tenant's existing
    // `tenant_configs.agreement_retention_years` (default 6, hence 'P6Y'), NOT a
    // second retention column: both windows answer the same question — how long
    // a professional record must survive — for the same tenant under the same
    // state rules and the same E&O cover, and two clocks that start equal drift.
    //
    // ⚠️ NOT YET ENFORCED — deadline 2027-02-01, carried on every rule below as
    // `enforcementStatus: 'pending'` so nothing can read them as implemented.
    // `retention-sweep.ts` reaches `agreement_requests` and `agreement_signers`
    // only; nothing expires an inspection address today, so these rules record a
    // decision no code acts on yet. That gap is the distance between the rule as
    // written and the rule as honoured — NOT a licence to read 'retain' as
    // 'forever', which is the rejected exclusion under another name.
    //
    // Why that date, so the next reader can argue with it rather than inherit
    // it. The sweep is not a patch: `inspections` has no purge marker (the
    // agreement pass keys on `signedAt` + `purged_at IS NULL`, and there is no
    // equivalent here), so an idempotent sweep needs a schema change and a
    // migration first; and nobody has yet chosen which column starts the clock
    // for an inspection. Two quarters covers that work with review, and is short
    // enough to land on someone who still holds the context. It is NOT derived
    // from when the first address actually falls due — that is not computable
    // until the clock column exists, which is precisely why the date has to come
    // from review discipline instead.
    //
    // Two mechanisms keep this honest. The gate refuses any pending rule that is

    // ── ai_call_provenance (AI governance ledger) ─────────────────────────────
    // One row per prompt sent to a model provider: which capability ran, which
    // adapter, on whose credentials, against which model, under which prompt
    // version, when. Written at the single AI chokepoint
    // (`AIService.callGemini`) so no AI feature can produce output without one.
    //
    // EVERY COLUMN IS LISTED, INCLUDING THE ONES THAT OBVIOUSLY HOLD NO PII.
    // Not one of these names matches `PII_HEURISTIC` in
    // `scripts/check-erasure-manifest.mjs`, so this whole table could have been
    // added and `lint:erasure` would have stayed green — the exact failure
    // `docs/compliance/erasure-heuristic-limits.md` describes, where silence
    // reads as coverage. The table is ruled on because somebody read it, not
    // because anything went red.
    //
    // WHY `retain` AND NOT A DELETION. There is nothing here to locate a data
    // subject BY and nothing to erase: the row records that a workspace made an
    // AI call, and it is scoped to the tenant, not to a person. That is a
    // design constraint, not a coincidence — the prompt text is deliberately
    // never stored (see the schema comment on `ai_call_provenance`) precisely
    // so this ledger cannot become a second copy of the client PII an
    // inspector's defect note carries. A DSAR over this table has no rows to
    // find. Basis art_17_3_b: it is the record that shows what an automated
    // system did on the tenant's behalf, and a governance log you can delete on
    // request cannot serve as one.
    //
    // NO `retention` PERIOD IS DECLARED, deliberately. A period here would be a
    // promise about expiring PERSONAL data, and these columns are not personal
    // data; declaring one would also require an `enforcementStatus`, and there
    // is no sweep — the shape this manifest calls an unbounded retain wearing a
    // temporary label. If a future column makes a row subject-linkable, that
    // column changes this reasoning and needs a period AND something to enforce
    // it.
    //
    // `endpoint` is the workspace's own configured destination, normalised so
    // it cannot carry a credential. It is not any person's data — it is where
    // the tenant chose to send their own workload — so it retains on the same
    // basis as every other column here: a governance record you can delete on
    // request cannot serve as one.
    //
    // ⚠️ REVIEWER NOTE. Columns that carry no personal data would normally be
    // declared in `ERASURE_OUT_OF_SCOPE` (`erasure-out-of-scope.ts`) with a
    // reason, which is arguably where these nine belong. They are recorded
    // here instead because a separate erasure-coverage audit was in flight over
    // that file when this landed and a concurrent edit to it would have been a
    // collision, not a decision. Moving them is a mechanical change and loses
    // nothing: the reasoning above travels with them.
