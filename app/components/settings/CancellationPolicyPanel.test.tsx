/**
 * The cancellation ladder and the agreement clause it depends on.
 *
 * What is pinned here is not "the panel renders". It is the four things that
 * would either charge a client money the agreement does not support, or silently
 * revoke the confirmation that makes the charge collectable.
 *
 *   - A fee with no current attestation MUST NOT be submitted. The server
 *     refuses it too; this is the gate that can say WHICH control is at fault.
 *   - `attestCancellationClause` MUST be absent from a save that confirms
 *     nothing. It is transient, and its `null` WITHDRAWS an attestation — so a
 *     helpful default on an unrelated fee edit would revoke the confirmation.
 *   - Zero on both rungs needs no clause at all. This is the INVERSION against
 *     the deposit next door, which refuses a zero outright.
 *   - Drift names the agreement and says the confirmation no longer applies.
 *
 * The first three read the submitted body rather than the DOM, because
 * `SegmentedControl` carries no hidden input — its value reaches the server only
 * because the component sends the state it owns.
