/**
 * BFF resource route for the command palette's `@` people prefix.
 *
 * F64 — the palette advertised `@ people` on its own hint row and answered
 * every such query with "No results found", because the only search it ran was
 * over the handful of recent inspections it had already loaded. The code said
 * `sources = []; // contacts would need a search endpoint`.
 *
 * It did not need one. `GET /api/contacts` has taken a `search` parameter all
 * along (`ContactListQuerySchema`), and `ContactService.listContacts` resolves
 * it as a real query against the contacts table. What was missing was this
 * route: engine `app/` code never calls `/api/*` directly (CLAUDE.md — the
 * token-relay BFF owns the JWT), so a component that wants server-side search
 * needs a loader to ask through.
 *
 * Narrow on purpose. It returns the four fields a palette row can show and
 * nothing else — no counts, no archived rows, no second page — so that it
 * cannot quietly become a second contacts list endpoint with its own opinions.
