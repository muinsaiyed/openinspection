            // only moment the fix is cheap. D1 refuses a CREATE TABLE above 100
            // columns, and what crosses that line is always one person adding
            // one column. At the push rung the schema, the migration and the
            // hand-maintained inline DDL have all already been written against

            // its history — the commit that introduced it still shows
            // `Bin 6576 -> 6577 bytes` with no line-level diff, forever, and so
            // does every `git log -p` and `git blame` that crosses it. Caught

            // subsystems and the oldest went unnoticed for months.

            // full run went red on a tree whose pre-commit hook was green.
            //
            // It earns pre-commit on the narrowest argument any entry here
            // makes: what it checks is decided by a single line in a single
            // file. A mount path is written once and is wrong the moment it is
            // typed -- there is no half-finished state for it to blame the
            // wrong commit for, which is the usual reason a gate belongs at
            // push instead. Its sibling `routedispatch` IS such a gate (two
            // files must agree) and is registered at PUSH for exactly that
            // reason; the two arriving together is what makes the distinction
            // legible. Cost: reads three files and matches route registrations
            // in them, no directory walk.
            'urltaxonomy',
            // Added 2026-09-05 with the LF gate, and the lock caught it too:

            // red on a tree whose pre-commit hook was green. That is twice in
            // three days, which is the argument for the lock rather than
            // against it.
            //
            // It earns pre-commit on `rawnul`'s argument, sharpened. THE REPAIR
            // STOPS BEING FREE THE MOMENT THE COMMIT EXISTS, and here it stops
            // being free for OTHER PEOPLE: a CRLF rewrite turns a three-line
            // edit into a whole-file diff, and a whole-file diff into a
            // whole-file merge conflict on every open branch that touches the
            // same file. Measured on this repository the same week -- one
            // in-place rewrite of `messages/*/settings.json` landed upstream as
            // 293 CRLF lines and left PR #333 conflicting on all of them, for a
            // real content difference of nine lines.
            //
            // A lone CR is the `rawnul` case exactly: git calls the file

            // "Binary file ... matches" with no line number. Ten files in this
            // repository were already in that state and nothing had reported

            // full run went red on a tree whose pre-commit hook and every one of
            // the 78 gates were green. Worth stating plainly, because it is the

            // produces a diff that reads as noise in a file nobody reviews line
            // by line. Nothing downstream ever goes red. That is exactly how 843

            // choose and may not be able to reach.

            //   - broaden the middleware's exemptions from exact matching to a
            //     prefix and every future path beneath one becomes exempt
            // None of those three fails a test, a type-check or a build. What
