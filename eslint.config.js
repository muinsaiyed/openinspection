/**
 * ESLINT_FAST — the pre-commit shape: same rules, no type information.
 *
 * Building the type-aware program is what eslint costs here, and on a commit it
 * buys nothing. Measured on this repo, cache cleared:
 *
 *     one staged server file    15.1s  →  3.7s
 *     two staged app files      15.8s  →  3.9s
 *
 * It buys nothing because every rule that NEEDS type information is 'warn'
 * (no-floating-promises and the no-unsafe-* family below), and `.lintstagedrc`
 * passes no `--max-warnings` — so eslint exits 0 no matter what those rules
 * find. The only error-level TypeScript rules are `no-explicit-any` and
 * `no-unused-vars`, and neither reads types. The hook was therefore spending
 * ~11.5s per commit building a program whose entire output was discarded.
 *
 * The warnings still matter — they are just meant to be READ, not raced past on
 * the way to a commit. `npm run lint` (CI's verify job) runs with no flag set
 * and stays the authority; nothing below changes what CI checks.

    // ── THE TWO LINES BELOW ARE WHERE UPSTREAM DECISIONS BECOME OURS ────
    //
    // Both presets are taken WHOLESALE, and both grow. ESLint and
    // typescript-eslint each state up front that a major version adds rules to
    // `recommended`, and that this can break an existing build. That is
    // documented, expected behaviour — not an unwatched channel. It announces
    // itself as a red `npm run lint`, which is the only rung that runs the full
    // set, so the signal arrives late but it does arrive.
    //
    // Measured 2026-08-25: `@eslint/js` v10 promoted `no-useless-assignment`
    // into `configs.recommended` at ERROR level. Nobody turned it on. It found
    // 34 pre-existing dead assignments across 27 files and turned a green lint
    // red — and every one of them was real.
    //
    // WHEN THAT HAPPENS AGAIN THERE ARE THREE OPTIONS, NOT TWO:
    //
    //   1. FIX THEM. The right answer when the findings are real and local, as
    //      those 34 were — half of them verifiable by tsc's definite-assignment
    //      analysis once the dead initialiser is dropped.
    //
    //   2. SUPPRESS THEM. `npx eslint --suppress-rule <name>` writes the
    //      existing violations into `eslint-suppressions.json` and leaves the
    //      rule at error, so NEW violations still fail; `--prune-suppressions`
    //      removes entries as they are fixed. It is the same baseline-ratchet
    //      shape as this repo's knip, file-size and tenant-scope gates, except
    //      that ESLint ships and maintains it. Reach for this when the count
    //      makes fixing a separate project rather than a task.
    //
    //   3. TURN IT OFF, with the reason written down — upstream's own guidance
    //      is a comment saying why, or a TODO linking to an issue. A severity
    //      downgrade with no stated reason is the one answer that is never
    //      acceptable, because it looks identical to nobody having noticed.
    //
    // ⚠️ OPTION 2 IS WHY THIS COMMENT EXISTS. Faced with those 34, the first
    // reaction was to downgrade the rule to 'warn' — because options 1 and 3
    // looked like the whole menu. They are not, and a false binary between
    // "fix all N now" and "stop enforcing it" is how a rule worth having gets
    // switched off at N=500.
    //
    // Note the `pending cleanup` policy further down is a DIFFERENT thing: it
    // governs the type-aware rules this config deliberately enables by name. A
    // core rule arriving inside a preset is not covered by it.

        // `*.config.ts` (vitest/playwright/drizzle/react-router) are build/tooling

        // type-aware parser can't resolve them. They don't need type-aware
        // linting — ignore them rather than widen the tsconfig projects.
        //

        // retired that: all 352 are in the app program now. Measured before
        // removing them, in BOTH gate shapes, and the two agree exactly because
        // every error-level rule here is syntactic:
        //
        //     ESLINT_FAST=1 (the pre-commit shape)   33 errors, 19 warnings
        //     type-aware    (the `npm run lint` CI shape)  33 errors, 332 warnings
        //
        //     20 no-explicit-any · 10 no-unused-vars · 2 no-console
        //     1 no-require-imports — across 15 of 352 files.
        //
        // The 332 warnings do not gate anything: no invocation of eslint in this
        // repo passes `--max-warnings` (see the FAST note at the top), so warnings
        // are output to read, and every type-aware rule below is 'warn'.
        //
        // Cost of including them in CI's type-aware pass is rule evaluation only,
        // NOT program construction: tsconfig.json already contains these 352 files
        // whether or not eslint lints them, so the program was being built for them
        // already.
        //
        // ── `tests/**` STAYS, and NOT for the old reason ────────────────────
        //
        // tsconfig.tests.json now exists, so "belongs to no TS project" is dead
        // there too — but it was never the operative fact and un-ignoring is not a
        // one-line diff. What is actually in the way, measured under ESLINT_FAST:
        //
        //   1581 errors across 364 of 856 files, of which
        //     970  no-restricted-syntax — 813 role literals + 135 status literals.
        //          These are the FIXTURE case the override block below already
        //          says is exempt ("Exempt: roles.ts itself, test files, …") and
        //          never actually listed, because tests were ignored when it was
        //          written. Listing them is the honest fix and belongs with a
        //          reading of what a role literal means in a fixture, not here.
        //      463 no-explicit-any — `as any` on partial fixtures. eslint flags a
        //          CAST, not just a declaration (verified: `} as any,` reports at
        //          the `any`), so this is the same 700-odd casts the tests/unit
        //          suppression burn-down is already working through. Relaxing the
        //          rule for specs would delete the only mechanical pointer at the
        //          failure it keeps finding — a cast that hides a dead fixture,
        //          leaving an assertion that cannot fail.
        //       83 import/order + import/first — "Definition for rule … was not
        //          found": stale `eslint-disable` comments naming
        //          eslint-plugin-import, which this repo does not use (it uses
        //          import-x). Deleting the comments is the fix.
        //
        // Two more things block the type-aware half specifically: `tests/**` is not
        // in `parserOptions.project` (tsconfig.tests.json would have to be added),
        // and even then `tests/e2e/**` plus the three files on tsconfig.tests.json's
        // burn-down ratchet belong to no project in that list and would be fatal
        // parse errors. So `tests/**` waits on that ratchet reaching zero.
        //
        // Note `tests/**` is not in `.lintstagedrc`'s glob either
        // (`{server,app,workers,packages}/**`), so un-ignoring it would change
        // nothing at commit time and land all 1581 in CI at once.
        // `backups/**` is the gitignored dump directory (D1 exports, and whatever
        // scratch a measurement leaves behind). Flat config does NOT read
        // .gitignore, so a single stray `.ts` landing here fails `npm run lint`
        // with a parse error — locally only, since CI checks out a tree where the
        // directory does not exist. That divergence is worse than the lint it
