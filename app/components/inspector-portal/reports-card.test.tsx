/**
 * The order's report list, and the one irreversible control on it.
 *
 * Two things are pinned. First, the delete confirmation NAMES what is lost:
 * the report by title, and that the content already filled into it is
 * destroyed. A generic "are you sure?" is the same dialog whether it is about
 * to discard an empty draft or a day of somebody's fieldwork.
 *
 * Second, the card never re-derives who may delete what. `canDelete` and
 * `deleteBlockedReason` come from the same server function the DELETE endpoint
 * enforces, so a blocked row is disabled AND says why — the failure mode being
 * guarded against is a button that looks live, does nothing, and explains
 * nothing.

 * The report-level narrative's absence is SHOWN, having been computed, carried

 *
 * `hasNarrative` is derived in `server/lib/inspection/reports.ts`, described at
 * length in the API schema, declared on `ReportRow`, and rendered by nothing.
 * The comment above the endpoint says "the hub carries hasNarrative"; the hub
 * carried it and never showed it, which is the same shape as the embed's
 * `siteKey` and is how the field-level census found it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS SHOWN AS A GAP RATHER THAN A TICK, and only before publication.
 * Surveyed 2026-09-08: Spectora's field app marks sections and items with
 * checkmarks as they are completed, so a completeness indicator on the
 * inspector's working surface is ordinary for the category. What the inspector
 * needs from a list of deliverables is what is still outstanding, so the row
 * speaks only when the narrative is missing — a badge on every finished row is
 * noise, and after publication an unwritten narrative is no longer a to-do.
