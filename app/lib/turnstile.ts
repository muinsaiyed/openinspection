 * Which theme to hand Turnstile, read off the scheme the page is painted with.

 * Turnstile's default is `auto`, and Cloudflare defines that as respecting
 * "the visitor preference" — `prefers-color-scheme`, the OS setting. That is
 * NOT this app's theme: `oi-color-scheme` is an explicit cookie the visitor
 * chooses, resolved onto `<html data-color-scheme>` before first paint by the
 * boot script in root.tsx. The two disagree precisely when someone has set a
 * preference, which is what a preference is for — a dark widget stranded in a
 * light booking form, or the reverse.
 *
 * `auto` is passed through rather than resolved here: in that mode our own CSS
 * is on `prefers-color-scheme` as well, so Turnstile's `auto` already matches
 * the page — and goes on matching it if the OS flips mid-visit, which a value
 * frozen at render time would not.
