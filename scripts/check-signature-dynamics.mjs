/**
 * lint:signature-dynamics — a signature may be a picture. It may never become a
 * biometric template.
 *
 * The invariant:
 *
 *   OpenInspection may persist a rendered signature image for execution and
 *   evidence purposes, but must not persist or derive a reusable biometric or
 *   behavioural signature template.
 *
 * ── Why a gate and not a note ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The pad ALREADY samples pointer pressure and coalesced events into
 * `StrokePoint { x, y, p }` in memory. Its handle exposes only `toDataURL`,
 * `isEmpty` and `clear`, so today the boundary holds by the ABSENCE OF ONE
 * ACCESSOR. That is one refactor from being untrue, and the cheapest possible
 * control is to write the prohibition down while it still costs nothing.
 *
 * ── The boundary a column grep cannot see ───────────────────────────────────
 * The inspector signature is written into `inspection_results.data` as
 * `_inspector_signature` — a JSON blob. A stroke payload could ride there with
 * NO schema change at all, so this gate scans for the stroke SYMBOLS and for
 * stroke-shaped request fields, never for column definitions.
 *
 * ── The exemption is a DIRECTORY ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `app/components/media-studio/` is where this data is legitimately handled: it
 * is drawn there, and it never leaves. An allowlist of file names would grow one
 * entry at a time until it described nothing; a directory boundary is the thing
 * actually being defended.
 *
 * ── Not `sigcompare` ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `scripts/check-signature-compare.mjs` (`lint:sigcompare`) already exists and
 * requires the OPPOSITE: it forces cryptographic verification through
 * `crypto.subtle.verify` or a constant-time compare. Same word, inverted duty.
 * The names must stay distinct or the two will be read as one rule.
 *
 * ── The other half of this invariant ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The first half above is about the INPUT: how the mark was made. This half is
 * about the USE: a signature image is never used or stored for biometric
 * AUTHENTICATION. It belongs in THIS gate rather than beside it, because
 * §1798.81.5(d)(1)(A)(vi) turns on "used to authenticate" — and split
 * across two gates someone could satisfy one while breaking the other. A pad
 * that captures nothing but a picture still crosses the line the moment that
 * picture is matched against a stored one to decide who somebody is.
 *
 * Three shapes, which are the three stages of every biometric pipeline:
 *
 *   6. FEATURE EXTRACTION from a signature image — the step that turns a
 *      picture into a key.
 *   7. A STORED signature-image TEMPLATE — the artefact the statute names.
 *   8. COMPARISON of two signature images — the authentication decision itself.
 *
 * What is NOT banned, and why the patterns carry `Image` explicitly:
 *
 *   - `signatureImageHash` is real (`server/api/inspections/agreements.ts`) and
 *     is the approved mechanism: a SHA-256 fingerprint of the stored image,
 *     which proves the record is unaltered and identifies nobody. A hash is not
 *     a feature vector, and this gate must never push anyone off it.
 *   - An email-signature TEMPLATE is an ordinary, unrelated product feature, so
 *     the template rule requires `Image` rather than banning the word.
 *   - `verifyTelnyxSignature`, `validateTwilioSignature`, `verifyInboundSignature`
 *     are cryptographic and are `lint:sigcompare`'s business — see below. Every
 *     rule here needs `Image` or an unambiguous biometric noun, so none of them
 *     can be reached from the word `Signature` alone.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-signature-dynamics.mjs [--self-test]

/**
 * Eight shapes, one boundary. 1-5 are the INPUT (how the mark was made); 6-8
 * are the USE (what the picture is then made to decide).
 *
 *  1. The stroke SYMBOLS themselves (`Stroke`, `StrokePoint`, the pad module) —
 *     the type-level tell that stroke data crossed the line.
 *  2. A stroke-shaped FIELD name (`strokes`, `strokePoints`, `signature_strokes`)
 *     in a schema, a column, or a request body.
 *  3. A bare `pressure` field. Pen pressure is the behavioural signal; a field
 *     called that in a schema is the template forming.
 *  4. `velocity` / `acceleration` on a signature — the other two behavioural
 *     axes a template is built from.
 *  5. Timing arrays keyed to a signature (`strokeTimings`, `pointTimestamps`).
 *  6. Feature extraction from a signature image (`extractSignatureImageFeatures`,
 *     `signatureImageFeatures`, `signature_image_descriptor`).
 *  7. A stored signature-image template (`signatureImageTemplate`,
 *     `enrollSignatureImage`, `signature_image_template`).
 *  8. Comparison of two signature images (`compareSignatureImages`,
 *     `signatureImageSimilarity`, `signature_image_match`).
 *
 * `ctx.stroke()` and `ctx.strokeStyle` are the Canvas API, not our data, and
 * `strokeWidth(pen, pressure)` is the pad's own rendering — the word alone is
 * not the offence, so the patterns require the data shape. Rules 6-8 are the
 * same discipline applied to the second half: `Signature` alone is not the
 * offence either, so each of them requires `Image` or a biometric noun.
