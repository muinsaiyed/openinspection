/**
 * Retention POLICY ratchet.
 *
 * The rule it enforces: any change to what production deletes, or when, must
 * produce a policy diff. It hashes the operative fields of the three retention
 * arrays and compares the result to `RETENTION_POLICY.rulesDigest`. Change a
 * window and the digest moves; the build then refuses until the policy header
 * moves with it, so the version bump lands in the same diff as the rule change
 * and a reviewer sees both at once.
 *
 * It cannot stop someone editing a rule and the digest together — no ratchet
 * can. What it removes is the SILENT case: a window edited on its own, shipped,
 * and discovered a year later with nothing in the history saying a policy
 * decision was made. The edit is still possible; it can no longer be invisible.
 *
 * ── The constant indirection, which is why this is not a copy of the portal's ─
 * The portal's rules carry literal windows, so hashing its manifest text sees
 * every change. This repository's rules carry constant REFERENCES and the
 * numbers live in `retention-windows.ts` — that file even says the existing
 * manifest gate "only ever parses `window.unit`, never the numeric value". A
 * digest over manifest text alone would sit still while `AUDIT_LOG_ANONYMIZE_
 * MONTHS` went from 24 to 12, which is the exact edit this gate exists to
 * surface. So every constant is resolved through `retention-windows.ts` and the
 * RESOLVED NUMBER is hashed. A name that cannot be resolved is an error, not a
 * name hashed as itself — hashing the unresolved name would produce a stable
 * digest that means nothing and a gate that reads green.
 *
 * Reporting follows this repo's rule that a gate prints both numbers, never a
 * verdict alone: rule, exclusion and open counts are printed on every run, pass
 * or fail. An empty parse — zero rules found because a refactor moved an array
 * — would otherwise be a stable digest of nothing and a green build. Zero rules
 * is a FAILURE here.
 *
