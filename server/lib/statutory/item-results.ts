/**
 * The inspection's answers, keyed the way a binding names them.
 *
 * -- THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE -------------------------------------------
 * A binding names an ITEM: `{ from: 'item', itemId: 'structural_foundations' }`.
 * An inspection does not store answers under item ids. It stores them under a
 * composite finding key -- `_default:structural:structural_foundations` -- so
 * that the same item can be answered separately per unit.
 *
 * The statutory collector was reading `results[itemId]` against the raw stored
 * object. Measured against real rows in a seeded database: every key is
 * composite, so every lookup missed, every binding resolved to the empty string,
 * and the authority's form rendered COMPLETELY BLANK. Nothing was red. The
 * fidelity gate passes, the render gate passes, every unit test passes -- they
 * build their `results` maps by hand, flat, which is the one shape the product
 * never produces. The only way to see it was to press the button.
 *
 * A blank box on an authority's form reads as an inspector who did not answer.
 * A blank FORM reads as an inspector who answered nothing at all, over their
 * signature.
 *
 * -- WHY THIS DOES NOT SILENTLY PICK A UNIT ---------------------------------
 * A multi-unit inspection answers one item once per unit. These forms describe
 * ONE dwelling -- TREC's is a single-family report -- so there is no honest way
 * to choose which unit's answer is "the" answer, and choosing quietly would
 * print one unit's findings under the address of the whole building. So the
 * default unit is what a form reads, and an item answered ONLY under some other
 * unit is reported rather than substituted.
