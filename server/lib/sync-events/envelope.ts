// CloudEvents 1.0 profile for the core -> portal user-sync seam (A-13).
//
// This module is the contract layer: it turns a raw `sync_outbox` row into a
// CloudEvents envelope that the portal consumer parses. It lives OUTSIDE
// server/portal/ on purpose so the DI container (server/lib/middleware/di.ts)
// and the scheduled sweeper can import it without breaching the portal
// isolation gate. It carries NO portal-specific knowledge — only the wire
// shape that both repos agree on via golden fixtures.
//
// Versioning rule (the actual A-13 contract):
//   - `type` is stable and never carries the version
//     (e.g. `io.inspectorhub.user.invited`).
//   - `dataschema` carries the version as `<kebab-event-name>/v<N>`
//     (e.g. `user-invited/v1`, `user-password-changed/v1`).
//   - Additive optional fields in `data` do NOT bump the version; consumers
//     ignore unknown fields and default missing optionals (tolerant reader).
//   - Breaking changes mint a new `dataschema` version.

 * past the template literal, and every such event reached the queue as
 * `io.inspectorhub.io.inspectorhub.tenant.…` with a matching junk dataschema.
 * Portal knew neither, so it parked them all — silently, because parking IS the
 * designed answer to an unknown type, and nothing distinguishes "a producer we
 * have not taught it yet" from "a name that cannot exist".
 *
 * Throwing is the loud version of the same refusal, and it lands where someone
 * looks: both callers (inline waitUntil publish, cron sweeper) catch and leave
 * the row `pending`, so `counts().oldestPendingAge` climbs and the sync-health
 * badge lights. The producer side is fenced at compile time (`OutboxEvent`
 * derives from `SyncEventType`), so reaching this throw means a row that
 * predates the fence — exactly the case worth seeing.
