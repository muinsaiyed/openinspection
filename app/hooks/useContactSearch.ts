 * A debounced Contacts typeahead, driven through the /inspections action.

 * The People step now runs two of these — the agent (IA-1) and the client
 * (Batch D) — and they were written the same way twice: set the text, open the
 * dropdown at two characters, clear the pending timer, submit the intent 300 ms
 * later. Written twice, the second copy is the one that misses the next fix.
 *
 * Each search gets its OWN fetcher (B-17 convention): a shared one cancels its
 * own in-flight request, so typing in one field would blank the other's results.
