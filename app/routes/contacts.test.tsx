/**
 * IA-96 — /contacts carried three tabs that did not belong together:
 *
 *   "Contacts"  the full list, plus a type dropdown
 *   "Agents"    the SAME list narrowed to type === 'agent' — i.e. one setting
 *               of the dropdown sitting next to it, presented as a peer. A
 *               superset and its own subset as siblings, and a filter whose
 *               scope nobody could guess.
 *   "Roles"     not people at all; tenant configuration. Moved to
 *               Settings -> Inspection roles.
 *
 * What should remain is one list and one filter. These tests pin that, plus
 * the two things the restructure had to not lose: the referral count the
 * Agents tab uniquely showed, and the third contact type ('other') that the
 * role vocabulary has always had.

/**

 * dropped a file on), which guessed which column held the name by matching
 * headers case-insensitively and, failing that, took the FIRST column. A guess
 * with no way to correct it, on the one question the file cannot answer.
 *
 * The wizard asks instead, and it asks on a run that can be reviewed, repaired
 * and undone. So what is asserted here is the ADDRESS and the ABSENCE:
 *
 *   1. every import control on this page resolves to the wizard's contacts
 *      entry, asserted as a set so a page with two controls pointing two ways
 *      fails even though both are links;
 *   2. using that control opens no paste form. Written as a CLICK, because the
 *      modal mounted its textarea only while open — the static "the document
 *      contains no textarea" form of this assertion is green against the very
 *      code it exists to reject.
