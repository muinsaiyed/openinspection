 * Portal cannot compute this. The erasure catalogue lives in this repo and is

 * it arrives on the wire — and portal refuses to mark a DSAR `completed` without
 * it, because writing "completed" with nothing behind it is an affirmative claim
 * that everything belonging to the subject was erased.
 *
 * Every field is REQUIRED for the same reason: an optional field is one a future
 * refactor drops without anything going red, and the record silently reverts to
 * a bare "completed".
 *
 * The two halves describe DIFFERENT things and must never be conflated:
 *   - `executedTables` is what THIS RUN actually touched, derived from the run's
 *     own decisions — not from the catalogue, and not from what it could have
 *     reached had there been rows.
 *   - `manifestRuleCount` / `outOfScopeCount` describe the CATALOGUE, a parallel
 *     document rather than the code path that ran. Hence the literal
 *     `catalogueIsAdvisory` flag: a UI cannot present one as the other.
 *   - `pendingRules` are catalogued-but-not-yet-enforced. A flat covered-count
 *     would report them as covered, which is the same false record in a new
 *     place, so the identifiers travel alongside their count.
 *
 * No count is validated against a literal here or on the portal side. Those
 * numbers move whenever the catalogue does; a baked-in expectation would be
 * stale within the month and is precisely the trap this disclosure closes. The
 * one thing asserted is INTERNAL CONSISTENCY — a disclosure whose `pendingRules`
 * and `pendingEnforcementCount` disagree is not a disclosure, so portal refuses
 * it and the reply parks for a human. Builder: `erasure-coverage.ts`.

 * against this registry at emit time, so the producer outgrew its own published
 * contract in silence, and the only party that noticed was the consumer, by
 * refusing every held reply that reached it.
 *
 * `coverage` is what a completion is MADE OF, so it lives on the `erased`

 * by a consumer that reads the payload, because the payload does not contain
 * it. `reason` is required on `held` for the mirror-image reason — it is the
 * sentence the data subject is given, and a held answer without one says "your
 * data was kept" and stops there.
 *
 * There is no third member, and the omission is load-bearing. A run that could
 * not complete — a step that threw, an unreadable holds table — emits NO reply
 * at all: it retries, and an exhausted retry becomes a dead command the console
 * shows. A member here for that ending would give it a shape a reader could

 * file", "it is ready", "it is about to expire". Nothing went the other way, so
 * the only way for the operator to discover a waiting run was to go looking for
 * one. This event is the other direction, and it is also what lets an operator

 *
 * ── Why `expiresAt` is on it ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A waiting run has a deadline, and a console that shows the queue without the
 * clock makes "nobody looked" indistinguishable from "nothing is due". The
 * number is EPOCH MILLISECONDS, matching the column it is read from — the
 * sibling tenant event carries SECONDS, which is exactly the kind of quiet
 * disagreement a golden fixture exists to pin.
 *
 * ── Why `vendor` is nullable, and not a guess ───────────────────────────────
 * Nothing has read this file. What may be carried is the operator's OWN
 * declaration of where the export came from; where they could not name one —
 * the entry point for "I have an export and do not know what it is" — this is
 * null. The stored row carries a placeholder vendor for schema reasons, and
 * putting that on the wire would publish a guess as a fact.
 *
 * ── Why `secondaryUseAuthorised` travels with the event ─────────────────────
 * The console has to SHOW it, and reading it later would be a second
 * cross-service call for something that was already true when this was written.
 * See `secondaryUseAuthorisedFor` in services/migration-intake/staff-access.ts
