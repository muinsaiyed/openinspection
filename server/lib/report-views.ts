/**
 * Report delivery confirmation — OI #271.
 *
 * "Did my client actually open the report?" answered without instrumenting the
 * recipient's browser. The server records its own handling of its own request:
 * three counters per (recipient, order), written when a report page is actually
 * rendered to a human who presented a live portal token.
 *
 * Nothing is stored on or read from the recipient's device — no cookie, pixel,
 * localStorage, sendBeacon or client listener — which is why ePrivacy
 * Art. 5(3) is not engaged and the lawful basis can be legitimate interests.
 * The assessment, and the eight other conditions it rests on, is
 * `docs/compliance/report-view-lia.md`. Adding any client-side signal to this
 * feature — including one meant to IMPROVE the counters' accuracy — voids it.
 *
 * The conditions that void it are restated as invariants and checked by
 * `npm run lint:view-invariants`, so a change here is stopped by this
 * repository rather than by a document that is not in it.
 *
 * view-invariant: no-client-instrumentation - no client-side instrumentation,
 *   for any reason, including one added to improve the accuracy of the
 *   counters. Everything this module decides is resolved server-side.
 * view-invariant: no-per-section-tracking - no dwell time, scroll depth,
 *   expanded sections or viewed photos. Three counters per (recipient, order)
 *   is the whole observation; anything finer is inference about the reader.
 *
 * This module holds the whole decision so it can be tested as a unit and so the
 * caller in `server/api/public-report.ts` stays one call wide.

 * A missing row reads as OFF, matching the column default: a workspace that has

 *  - **Not a GET.** `HEAD` is what link checkers and some mail gateways issue.

 *    `Sec-Purpose: prefetch`/`prerender` are the browser telling us no human
 *    has seen this yet.
 *  - **Render mode.** The headless PDF browser fetches the report page on
 *    publish, on email send, and on every PDF download — the product opening
 *    its own document, several times per order.
 *  - **Owner preview.** The inspector reading their own report is not the
 *    client receiving it, and "opened 4 times" that the inspector produced
 *    themselves is the most misleading number this feature could show.
 *
 * These are heuristics and the design says so out loud: a determined scanner
 * issues a plain `GET` and is indistinguishable from a reader (LIA §3.4(a)).
 * The remedy for that is the inspector-facing surface never presenting "opened"
