# OpenInspection Workflow

## 1. Data Model — Template-Driven JSON Schema

Inspection forms are not flat database tables. Two key tables:

### `templates`

Form structure as JSON in the `schema` column. Each tenant has one or more templates.

```json
{
  "title": "Standard Home Inspection",
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "sec_exterior",
      "title": "Exterior",
      "items": [
        {
          "id": "item_roof",
          "title": "Roof Coverings",
          "type": "rich"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**9 item types**: `rich` (rating + 3 canned-comment tabs) plus `boolean`, `text`, `textarea`, `number`, `select`, `multi_select`, `date`, `photo_only`. Rating stored on `result.rating`, non-rich values on `result.value`.

**Rating systems** are configurable per template (`rating_system_id` → `rating_systems` table). Each system defines levels with labels, colors, and severity buckets.

Schema is validated by `server/lib/validations/template.schema.ts` (single canonical v2 format).

`items` is a flat, ordered array even when the form it represents is nested: an item nests by naming another item in the same section as its `parentId`, and the array stays in pre-order. Before adding a field to an item, or writing anything that walks `section.items`, read [`template-item-hierarchy.md`](template-item-hierarchy.md) — both have a failure mode that prints less rather than throwing.

### `inspection_results`

Inspector's field responses as JSON in `data`. One row per inspection.

```json
{
  "item_roof": { "rating": "Defect", "notes": "Missing 3 shingles", "media": ["uuid-photo"] },
  "item_siding": { "rating": "Satisfactory", "notes": "" }
}
```

Keys are item IDs from the template. Only items the inspector interacted with are stored (sparse).

## 2. Field Collection

Field collection happens in the inspection editor (`app/routes/inspection-edit.tsx`) — the single fill surface. Values are captured through the findings API into the collaborative results document (`app/lib/collab/results-binding.ts`), keyed by the composite `finding-key`. (The former standalone offline form-renderer route was retired; there is no separate mobile form surface.)

**Field-level merge**: writes are last-write-wins per item key — only changed items need to be sent. The bulk write path is `POST /api/inspections/:id/results/batch` (there is no `PATCH /api/inspections/:id/results` route).

## 3. Photo Upload Pipeline

```
POST /api/inspections/:id/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Worker stores the file in R2 under `{tenantId}/{inspectionId}/{filename}`. Photos are read back through `GET /api/inspections/:id/photo?key=<r2-key>` — role-guarded, and scoped to the caller's tenant and inspection by the key prefix. The R2 key contains `/`, which is why it travels as a query parameter rather than a path segment. The public report viewer has its own token-scoped twin in `public-report.ts`.

(There is no `GET /api/inspections/files/:key`. This page named one for a long time and no such route has ever existed.)

Photos can have annotations and captions (`inspection_media_pool` table).

## 4. Report Generation & PDF

When an inspection is published:
1. `inspections.status` is set to `'published'`
2. A report version snapshot is created (`report_versions` table)
3. Email sent to client with report link
4. Report rendered as HTML with print stylesheet — users invoke `window.print()` for PDF

Report viewer: `app/routes/public/report.tsx` (card-stack layout with section navigation).

## 5. Canned Comments & AI

**Canned comments**: 250+ pre-written inspection comments in `comments` table. 3-tab picker (Satisfactory / Monitor / Defect) on each `rich` item. Slash-trigger (`/`) opens snippet picker in the notes field.

**AI assistance** (`server/api/ai.ts`):

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/ai/comment-assist` | Professional rewrite of inspector's note |
| `POST /api/ai/auto-summary` | Bullet-point summary of all defects |

Both go through the one OpenAI-compatible adapter, at whatever endpoint and
model the deployment or the company configured — there is no compiled-in vendor
or model, and with `AI_MODEL` / `AI_BASE_URL` unset both fail closed with a 503.
See [AI](../integrations/ai.md).

## 6. Template Management

| Endpoint | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/inspections/templates` | Any | List templates |
| `POST /api/inspections/templates` | admin/owner | Create (name + schema JSON) |
| `PUT /api/inspections/templates/:id` | admin/owner | Update, bumps version |
| `DELETE /api/inspections/templates/:id` | admin/owner | Delete (409 if in use) |

Bringing templates over from another product is not an endpoint on this router: it goes through the import wizard at `/settings/imports?intent=templates.create`, which asks which product the file came from, shows what the conversion produced before anything is written, and stages the run so it can be reviewed and repaired.

**Marketplace**: a curated catalogue of first-party template packs, served by `GET /api/marketplace/templates` with one-click install. It is **not** community-contributed content, and the browsing UI is **SaaS-only** — in the default `standalone` deployment mode nothing populates the catalogue, so `/library/marketplace` returns 404 and the Library hub does not offer the tile. The API handlers remain mounted in both modes. To pick up starter content a release ships, use Settings → Data → **Install what's new** (`POST /api/admin/data/install-bundled-content`).

## 7. Availability & Booking

Inspectors manage weekly schedule + date overrides via `availability` / `availability_overrides` tables.

Public booking: the page is a React Router route at `/book/:tenant`, and its data comes from `GET /api/public/book/:tenant` (all services and available slots). The system auto-assigns the first available qualified inspector. An optional inspector-choice dropdown is shown when the tenant enables "Allow clients to choose their inspector" (Settings → Online Booking → Booking policies). Customer submits via `POST /api/public/book` with Turnstile bot protection. Legacy per-inspector URLs `/book/:tenant/:slug` redirect 302 to the company page with that inspector pre-selected.

## 8. Execution Flow

```
1. Admin/inspector creates inspection
   → selects template, assigns inspector, enters address + client info

2. Inspector opens inspection in the editor (/inspections/:id/edit)
   → template JSON parsed into interactive checklist
   → keyboard-driven: 1-5 ratings, / snippet picker, Cmd-K palette
   → every edit lands in the Yjs results document, buffered in IndexedDB

3. Inspector photographs defects
   → POST /api/inspections/:id/upload → R2
   → binary upload needs a connection; offline it is declined, not queued

4. The Durable Object merges and persists
   → edits sync over the collab WebSocket; the DO is the only writer of
     inspection_results.data, and it also stores the binary CRDT state
   → offline edits merge on reconnect with no lost operations

5. Inspector publishes report
   → report version snapshot created
   → email sent to client with report link

6. Client receives email → opens report
   → signs agreement if required
   → pays via Stripe if required
   → full report accessible
```
