/**
 * New Inspection wizard — template matching and the final review.
 *
 * Two things the wizard used to do in markup, moved here so they can be read
 * and tested on their own:
 *
 *  - matchTemplates: the template picker was a filter box, a <select> the filter
 *    narrowed, and an echo line repeating the selected name — three controls and
 *    an invisible fourth behaviour (typing until one template matched selected
 *    it) for a single decision. One combobox needs only the filter rule.
 *
 *  - summariseNewInspection: the wizard's last step was whichever thin step came
 *    last, so "Create" was pressed with no statement of what would be created.
 *    A wrong template picked on step 1 was unreviewable by the time it mattered.
