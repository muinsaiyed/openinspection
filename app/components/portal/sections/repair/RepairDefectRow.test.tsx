 * #275 — the quick-phrase buttons under the repair-request note field.
 *
 * The one that matters is the APPEND test. A convenience button that eats what
 * the user typed is worse than no button at all, and the failure mode is silent:
 * the note simply reads differently than it did a second ago.
 *
 * `phrases` is OPTIONAL on purpose. The row is the single component both portals
 * render (see app/components/agent/cross-portal-reuse.test.tsx), and the agent
 * surface has no note field at all, so it passes no phrases.
