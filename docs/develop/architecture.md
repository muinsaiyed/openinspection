# Architecture

OpenInspection is a home inspection app deployed as a single Cloudflare Worker (the cloudflare/react-router-hono-fullstack-template shape): a Hono entry that mounts the full API in-process and delegates page routes to React Router v8 SSR. This doc covers the high-level architecture for self-hosters, contributors, and reviewers.

> Self-hosted instances run **standalone** (single-tenant) — the default in `wrangler.jsonc`. The engine is tenant-aware under the hood (every table carries `tenant_id`), but you don't manage tenants or subdomains; one fixed tenant holds all your data.

## Single-Worker Architecture

OpenInspection runs as ONE Cloudflare Worker. `workers/app.ts` is a Hono app that is the worker entry: it mounts the full API (`server/`) for API-owned paths and delegates everything else (page routes) to the React Router v8 SSR handler.

```

- **`workers/app.ts`** — a Hono app is the worker entry. It routes API-owned paths (`/api/*`, `/status`, `/m2m/*`, `/photos/*`, `/.well-known/*`, `/doc`, `/sso`, `/sign/*`, `/webhooks/*`, `/agent/magic-login`, the ICS feed) to the API app and sends everything else to the React Router v8 SSR handler. `/mcp` and `/mcp/{slug}` are deliberately absent from that list: when MCP is enabled the OAuth provider wrapper owns that prefix and the request never reaches this router; when it is off the path falls through to the SSR 404. It injects an in-process `API_WORKER` self-binding so React Router loaders/actions call the API app DIRECTLY (no network hop, no second worker, no Service Binding between workers).
- **`server/`** — Hono + Drizzle + D1. Handles all business logic, authentication, and data access. Exposes a typed JSON API.
- **`app/`** — React Router v8 + React 19 + Tailwind v4. Server-side renders the React UI on the edge.
- **Shared UI** (`packages/shared-ui/`) — Design System 0523 token-based React components (Button, Pill, Card, etc.). `packages/shared-ui/src/index.ts` is the authoritative list; [`design-system.md`](design-system.md) describes each one.
- **API Types** (`packages/api-types/`) — Re-exports the Hono app type so the web layer's `hono/client` gets full end-to-end type safety.

The web layer uses a **Token Relay BFF** pattern: the React Router v8 server holds the JWT cookie and forwards it to the in-process API on every request, so the browser never sees the token directly.

### Why React Router v8

- **SPA navigation**: page transitions without full reload — inspectors switch between editor/dashboard/templates frequently
- **React 19**: future React Native app can reuse hooks and state logic (useInspection, useFindings, useSync)
- **SSR on Workers**: full server rendering at the edge, same latency as static HTML
- **hono/client**: Hono exports `AppType`, React Router v8 uses `hono/client` for compile-time type-safe API calls — zero handwritten API client
- ⚠️ **CPU per request is NOT ~1-3ms.** This line used to read "CF Free Tier
  safe: React Router v8 SSR adds ~1-3ms CPU per request, well within 10ms
  limit". Measured against a live deployment on 2026-09-05, over seven days of
  real traffic: **p50 8ms, p95 49ms, p99 106ms, max 494ms**. A statutory-form
  render is ~470ms in workerd on its own. The old figure was an SSR microcost
  quoted as if it were the request, and it was never re-measured.
  A plan capping CPU in the low milliseconds will kill ordinary page loads —
  observed, as HTTP 1102, on a plain settings page.

> **The same arithmetic has to be done for the scheduled path, and for a long time it was not.**
> The Workers Free CPU ceiling is 10 ms **per invocation**, and it applies to a cron
> invocation exactly as it applies to a request. The line above was written about `fetch`
> and nothing ever wrote the equivalent for `scheduled`, which ran thirteen background jobs
> serially in one invocation — measured at 138 ms, 13.8x the ceiling, with ticks being
> killed outright. See [Background work](#background-work) for the shape that replaced it.

## Request flow

### Page (React Router v8) flow

```
Browser request
   ↓
Cloudflare edge → single Worker (workers/app.ts) → Hono routes non-API paths to RR SSR
   ↓
React Router v8 server (SSR):
   1. Route matched → loader() or action() executes
   2. Reads session cookie (Token Relay BFF)
   3. Calls the in-process API via the injected API_WORKER binding (hono/client) — no network hop
   4. Renders React component tree to HTML
   ↓
HTML + hydration bundle sent to browser
   ↓
Client-side: React hydrates, subsequent navigations use client-side routing
```

### API flow

```
API request (from an RR loader/action via the in-process API_WORKER binding, or direct over HTTP)
   ↓
Cloudflare edge → single Worker (workers/app.ts) → Hono routes API-owned paths to the API app
   ↓
Hono middleware stack, in the order `server/index.ts` registers it
(pinned by tests/unit/platform/middleware-order.spec.ts):
   1. CSP / security headers
   2. Context bootstrap
   3. Tenant router (standalone: pins the one fixed tenant)
   4. Branding resolver (KV → D1 fallback)
   5. Tenant-active guard
   6. JWT auth (skipped on the public prefixes)
   7. Agent terms gate
   8. Idempotency guard (mutating routes)
   9. Integration secrets (merges the tenant's decrypted keys into a COPY of env)
  10. DI proxy (lazy-instantiates services)
  11. Inspector palette
  12. Last-active touch (/api/* only)
   ↓
Bot protection (Turnstile) is NOT in this stack — it is applied per route, on
the two surfaces an anonymous visitor can submit to. See
[`../integrations/turnstile.md`](../integrations/turnstile.md).
   ↓
Route handler reads validated input via c.req.valid('json')
   ↓
Handler calls c.var.services.xxx (auto-tenant-scoped)
   ↓
Service queries D1 (Drizzle) / R2 / KV / external API
   ↓
Response via sendSuccess() / sendError() (canonical envelope)
```

## Tenancy model

Every D1 table includes `tenant_id` (NOT NULL) so the data model is tenant-aware, but a
self-hosted instance runs **standalone**: `SINGLE_TENANT_ID` pins all data to one fixed
tenant. You never manage tenants or subdomains. Tenant resolution lives in
`server/features/tenant-routing/`; in standalone the `tenantRouter` middleware simply pins
the request to `profile.fixedTenantId` (`resolve-by-fixed-tenant.ts`).

> A SaaS overlay (`server/portal/`, active only when `APP_MODE=saas`) lets a multi-tenant deployment hand tenant records, seats and credentials to an external control plane over the machine-to-machine seam described in [`reference/api.md`](../reference/api.md). Standalone builds execute none of it: `hasPortalIntegrationApi` is false, so `/api/platform/*` is not mounted at all. The code is here and readable; what runs on the other end of that seam is not part of this repository.

### Reading a deployment capability

Mode-dependent behaviour comes from `server/lib/deployment-profile.ts` — the one
place that reads `env.APP_MODE`. Read a capability; never branch on the mode
yourself. Three sanctioned readers, by what you are holding:

| You hold | You read |
|---|---|
| a Hono handler / middleware | `c.var.profile.<capability>` |
| only an env (RR loader or action, cron, Workflow, queue consumer) | `getDeploymentProfile(env).<capability>` |
| a client component | `isSaas` / `deployment.mode` from the session context |

`getDeploymentProfile` takes `ProfileEnv` (the three fields it reads), not
`AppEnv`, so every env shape in the worker satisfies it with no cast.
`tests/unit/sync/portal-isolation.spec.ts` enforces the rule.

## Authentication

- Login → server signs JWT (ES256 with `kid` header, includes `iat` claim) → sets `__Host-inspector_token` HttpOnly cookie
- Each request: middleware verifies JWT signature + checks `iat >= KV[pwchanged:userId]`
- Password change: writes `pwchanged:userId = now()` to KV → invalidates all prior tokens server-side
- Browser JS never sees the token (HttpOnly enforced); same-origin `fetch()` sends the cookie automatically.
- The web layer uses Token Relay BFF: the React Router v8 server reads the cookie and forwards it to the in-process API on every request.

## E-signature (Spec 5H)

### Trust model

Per-tenant Ed25519 keypair generated on first use (`SigningKeyService.ensureKeypair`). The private key is AES-GCM encrypted with `KEY_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` and stored in D1; the public key is exposed unauthenticated at `/.well-known/openinspection/tenant-keys/:slug` (1-hour cache) so any third party can verify signatures independently.

### Audit chain

Each signature event appends a row to `esign_audit_logs` whose `prev_hash` = SHA-256 of the canonical JSON of the previous row. Editing any row invalidates the chain from that point onward — detectable by re-deriving hashes. The chain is signed with the tenant's Ed25519 private key at every append, not just at sign time.

### Sign flow

Customer signs at `/agreements/sign/:tenant/:token` → API writes an `agreement.signed` audit row, generates a `verificationToken`, and fires `SignCompletionWorkflow` asynchronously. The synchronous response to the customer is immediate; PDF generation happens in the background.

### Workflow steps (`SignCompletionWorkflow`)

1. Render `signed.pdf` via `env.BROWSER.quickAction("pdf", { url })` (Browser Run) → store in R2.
2. Render `certificate.pdf` the same way → store in R2.
3. Assemble `evidence.zip` (signed.pdf + certificate.pdf + audit-log JSON).
4. Append `workflow.complete` audit row recording the SHA-256 hashes of all three artifacts.
5. Email the client via Resend with `signed.pdf` and `evidence.zip` as attachments.

Browser Run requires `compatibility_date >= "2026-03-24"` in `wrangler.jsonc` and uses the free tier (10 browser-minutes/day — sufficient for typical inspection volume). Admin download endpoints for signed.pdf, certificate.pdf, and evidence.zip are Worker-proxied from R2.

**Correction, and what the three downloads say about themselves.** A published report is corrected by AMENDMENT, never in place: `correctReport` (`server/services/report-correction.service.ts`) applies the change to the record and publishes version N+1 through the same snapshot path, so the delivered version stays byte-identical and its hash chain goes on verifying. The three downloads above are part of the same graph rather than a separate one — they are files the product actively serves, not an archive or a backup, so each 200 carries `x-artifact-status: current | superseded`, resolved from the amendment ledger by `server/lib/artifact-status.ts`. A superseded artefact is still retrievable as historical evidence; what changes is that it no longer claims to be the current answer.

The cache directives are part of that claim rather than a separate concern. A status header describes right now, so `current` responses are sent `private, no-cache, must-revalidate` and `superseded` ones `private, no-store`. The `private, max-age=300` these endpoints used to send let a copy fetched shortly before a correction go on claiming `current` for five minutes afterwards inside the client's own cache.

### Verification flow

- **Public verifier** (`/v/:verificationToken`): SSR page resolves the token to an envelope, runs a server-side audit-chain integrity check and Ed25519 signature check, and displays the result with download links. QR code on signed.pdf and certificate.pdf points here.
- **Offline self-verify** (`/verify`): accepts an `evidence.zip` upload and re-runs SHA-256 chain re-derivation + Ed25519 signature verification entirely in the browser via Web Crypto API — no server involvement, court-friendly independence from the operator.

### Optional features

- **D1 — Inspector pre-sign**: inspector can sign the agreement before sending to the client via `POST /api/admin/agreement-requests/:id/inspector-sign`. The render handler conditionally adds an inspector signature block when present.
- **D2 — Auto-sign on publish**: per-inspection `auto_sign_on_publish` flag (plus a tenant-level default). When an inspector has a saved `users.default_signature_base64` and the flag is set, `InspectionService.publishInspection` auto-injects the inspector's signature into `inspection_results.data` at publish time. The report viewer and print output render the signature block automatically.

### Invariant: a signature is a picture, never a biometric template

A rendered signature **image** may be persisted for execution and evidence
purposes. A reusable biometric or behavioural signature template may not be
persisted or derived — not stroke geometry, not pen pressure, not timing.

This is not a hypothetical boundary. The pad already samples pointer pressure
and coalesced events into `StrokePoint { x, y, p }` while you draw. Its handle
exposes only `toDataURL`, `isEmpty` and `clear`, so **today the invariant holds
because one accessor does not exist** — which is one refactor from being untrue.

Two properties make it enforceable rather than aspirational:

- The exemption is a **directory**, `app/components/media-studio/`. That is
  where the data is legitimately handled and where it stops. An allowlist of
  file names would grow one entry at a time until it described nothing.
- The gate scans for the stroke **symbols and field shapes**, not for column
  definitions. The inspector signature is written into `inspection_results.data`
  as `_inspector_signature`, which is a JSON blob — a stroke payload could ride
  there with no schema change at all, and a column grep would never see it.

Enforced by `npm run lint:signature-dynamics`
(`scripts/check-signature-dynamics.mjs`), in the `lint` chain and
`lint:gates-full`. Not to be confused with `lint:sigcompare`, which enforces the
opposite duty on cryptographic verification: that it goes through
`crypto.subtle.verify` or a constant-time compare.

### The second half: a signature is never an authenticator

The rule above is about the **input** — how the mark was made. The second half is
about the **use**: a signature image is never used or stored for biometric
**authentication**. A pad that captures nothing but a picture still crosses the
line the moment that picture is matched against a stored one to decide who
somebody is.

It lives in the **same gate** rather than beside it. The statutory test turns on
the words "used to authenticate", so the two halves are one boundary seen from
two angles, and two separate gates could each pass while it broke between them.

Three shapes are banned, and they are the three stages of every biometric
pipeline:

| stage | banned shape | example |
|---|---|---|
| feature extraction | turning the image into a key | `extractSignatureImageFeatures` |
| enrolment | storing a template of the image | `signatureImageTemplate` |
| comparison | matching two images to decide identity | `compareSignatureImages` |

**Hashing the image is the approved alternative and is deliberately untouched.**
`signatureImageHash` — a SHA-256 fingerprint recorded at signing — proves the
stored record is unaltered and identifies nobody. Every pattern requires either
the word `Image` or an unambiguous biometric noun, so a hash never reaches them,
and neither do the cryptographic `verify*Signature` functions that
`lint:sigcompare` requires.

Two design notes that were bought with a mutation proof rather than reasoning:

- The patterns carry **no leading word boundary**. A planted
  `loadSignatureImageTemplate(...)` passed silently the first time, because a
  word boundary cannot match between `load` and `Signature`; any verb prefix
  walked straight through. The end of the identifier is what carries the
  meaning, so only the trailing boundary is kept.
- **No prefix is exempted**, `email` included. An email-signature template that
  happened to hold an image would trip this and should be renamed, or argued
  about in the open. That is a far cheaper failure than a biometric template
  hidden behind a prefix somebody once added to an exemption list.

### Related: the claims the product may not make about any of this

`npm run lint:verification-copy` (`scripts/check-verification-copy.mjs`) is the
copy-side companion, and it is a **Global Core control —
Verification Claim Integrity**, not a regional overlay: it is load-bearing under
FTC Act §5, state UDAP statutes, contract expectation and evidentiary integrity
at once. It scans every message catalogue, in every locale, for copy that
converts an integrity result into a conclusion about human authorship, identity,
intent, consent or legal validity — "Signature Verified", "Valid Signature",
"Signer Verified", "Signed by [person]" and the rest. A **disclaimer does not
rescue an over-broad claim; narrow the claim.** What is permitted is the claim
narrowed to the check that ran: *"The stored signature image matches the
signature image fingerprint recorded at signing."*

## Service layer

Each domain has a service class with:

- Constructor receiving `db` (or `ScopedDB`) + `tenantId`
- Methods that filter by `tenant_id` automatically (via `ScopedDB` wrapper)
- No direct DB calls in route handlers — always via service

Example:

```typescript
// In a route handler:
const inspections = await c.var.services.inspection.list({ status: 'in_progress' });
// c.var.services.inspection is auto-instantiated with c.get('tenantId')
```

The DI proxy in `server/lib/middleware/di.ts` lazy-instantiates each service on first access per request.

## Frontend layer

- **React Router v8 SSR**: Routes in `app/routes/` use `loader()` for data fetching and `action()` for mutations. Full server-side rendering on Cloudflare Workers.
- **React components**: `app/components/`, organized by domain (inspection, template, booking, media-studio, portal, …). Counts are not written here because they go stale between releases; `ls app/components` is the answer.
- **Hooks**: `app/hooks/` holds the state hooks the editor is built from — `useInspection`, `useFindings`, `useKeyboard` (shortcuts), `useCannedComments`, `usePresence` (WebSocket), `useTheme`, `useUnsavedChanges`, `useSessionContext`, and the `findings/` and `inspection/` sub-hook directories.
- **Design tokens**: Tailwind v4 with Design System 0523 tokens in `app/styles/tailwind.css`.
- **Shared UI**: `packages/shared-ui/` provides the design-system components (Button, Pill, Card, …) consumed by the frontend; its `src/index.ts` is the list.
- **Dark mode**: `data-color-scheme` attribute on `<html>`, managed by `useTheme` hook (auto/light/dark).

### Future app path

1. **PWA** (current) — installable, and offline-capable for field data: the
   results document is a Yjs CRDT buffered in IndexedDB and merged on reconnect
   (see [`../concepts/collab-editing.md`](../concepts/collab-editing.md)). The
   `useOfflineQueue` hook this line used to name was retired with the rest of
   the bespoke offline layer in #181. Photo and video BINARY upload still
   requires a connection — it writes to R2 — so that half is not offline-capable
   and the editor says so rather than queueing.
2. **A native client** (direction, unspecified) — designed for the field rather
   than inherited from the browser: capture, local storage, sync and conflict
   resolution are the requirement, not follow-ups to a shell.

**Capacitor was on this list and is not any more** (2026-08-18). It was a
WebView wrapper with native camera and offline capture deferred to later work,
and those deferred items are the actual requirement — an inspector works
basements and crawlspaces with no usable connection. That is a judgement about
what this product needs, not about the tool. Until a native client exists,
responsive web is the field surface.

## Authoring surfaces

Two pages author the same shape. `/templates/:id/edit` writes a template's
schema; `/inspections/:id/edit` fills in results against a snapshot of that
schema. The two route trees and their state hooks are deliberately **not**
merged — one changes a schema, the other changes results, and that is a real
difference. What they share is the component set and the data shapes.

### One mode-aware component set, not two trees

For a while there were two of everything. One `SectionRail` addressed sections
by array index and could only reorder them; a second addressed them by id and
had grown progress rings, structural editing and save-to-template. The
inspection-side copy was by then a strict superset of the authoring-side one,
which is the tell: the fork was not expressing a difference, it was losing
fixes on whichever copy the next change did not touch.

The structural components now exist once, under
`app/components/editor-shared/`, and take `mode: 'author' | 'fill'`
(`editor-shared/editor-mode.ts`):

| Component | `author` renders | `fill` renders |
|---|---|---|
| `SectionRail` | item counts | progress donut, defect count, the Inspection Details overview entry |
| `ItemList` | item-type badges | rating state, batch selection |
| `SideRail` | Preview / Library | Preview / Library / Photos |

`SideRail` is the exception to the directory: it still lives at
`app/components/editor/SideRail.tsx` and imports `EditorMode` from
`editor-shared/`. It is mode-aware but has not moved.

**The item detail panel is the one thing that stays forked, and it says why.**
Configuring an item's type and its canned entries
(`components/template/ItemPropertiesPanel.tsx`, `ItemCommentsPanel.tsx`) and
rating one in the field (`components/editor/ItemEditor.tsx`) are different jobs,
not one job with a flag. They share the atoms instead of the panel —
`ItemHeader`, `CannedCommentRow`, `DefectCategoryChip`, `InlineRename`,
`RatingSegment`, all under `editor-shared/`.
`components/template/preview-parity.test.ts` renders one canned entry through
both the template preview and the editor's SideRail and compares what a reader
sees, so the two cannot drift in silence.

Five things were retired to get here, and none of them should come back:

- **The duplicate `SectionRail` and `ItemList`.** One of each, addressed by id.
- **A second inspection-filling route**, `/inspections/:id/form`, with its own
  renderer. It was an orphan — registered in `routes.ts`, linked from nowhere —
  and it was also the only place the eight non-`rich` item types and
  `item.description` were ever rendered, so the live editor was the one missing
  them. Both now render in `ItemEditor`; the route and its renderer are gone.
  `FormField` (`app/components/form/FormField.tsx`) survives as the building
  block `ItemEditor` reuses for non-`rich` input, which writes to
  `result.value`. `item.description` is inspector-facing guidance: it shows in
  the editor and is never emitted to the report or to the client.
- **Per-section authored applicability.** A right-hand rail let a template
  author declare which property types and commercial subtypes each section
  applied to. It drove a preview and nothing else — the resolver never acquired
  a production caller. Templates now identify by property type instead, which
  picks the seed content and gates the commercial report block.
  `server/lib/section-applicability.ts` is frozen dead code that says so at the
  top: two unit specs still exercise it directly, and `applicableTo` stays in
  the template JSON schema to avoid OpenAPI-snapshot churn, round-tripping
  untouched through `app/lib/editor/template-meta.ts`. Do not re-wire it into
  an editor.
- **The second rating-system editor.** A modal in the template editor authored
  one level shape while the library page authored another, bridged one way, and
  `pausesAdvance` could not be edited from either. There is now one
  `RatingSystemEditor` (`app/components/RatingSystemEditor.tsx`) and one
  canonical level shape — `{ id, label, abbreviation, color, severity,
  isDefect, pausesAdvance?, hotkey?, order }`.
- **Three different reorder gestures** for the same operation (drag here, arrow
  buttons there, a dropdown menu somewhere else). Dragging is the gesture, via
  `editor-shared/useSortableReorder.ts`, with the arrow/menu path kept as the
  keyboard-reachable fallback rather than as a second way of doing it.

### A feature that touches the editor extends a dimension

`mode` was the first dimension and is not the only one. The shared interfaces
reserve two more, and a feature that touches the editor is expected to extend
one of them rather than grow a parallel tree:

- **Unit / scope.** `SectionRail` and `ItemList` take `activeUnitId`, which
  chooses whose results are being read; the finding key is
  `{unitId}:{sectionId}:{itemId}`. A per-unit inspection is this editor with a
  scope selected, not a second editor. The unit tree (`inspection_units`,
  building → floor → unit, at most three levels) is opt-in, and it is what makes
  a site with several structures one inspection. Expressing the unit axis by
  duplicating a section per unit was rejected: that puts it in the template,
  where it has to be re-authored for every property.
- **Location.** A tagged inspection walks the checklist once and labels each
  finding with a location drawn from `inspections.location_options` — a flat
  list, because what a tagged walk needs is a label and not a hierarchy.
  Modelling it as a tree would make the lightest mode sit on the heaviest data
  structure for no gain.

`inspections.unit_inspection_mode` (`tagged | per_unit`) picks between them, and
it is a **per-inspection setting rather than a live toggle**, because it decides
the shape of the whole checklist: `tagged` is one pass with location labels,
`per_unit` is a complete sub-inspection per unit.
`server/services/unit-switch.service.ts` converts in both directions —
promoting flat location labels into single-level unit nodes going up, merging
unit labels back into the picklist coming down.

Building a bespoke authoring surface for a new deliverable has been tried here
and retired; the applicability rail above is that attempt. Commercial PCA work
therefore rides these same two editors, with a commercial property type as the
template's identity, and adds itself as a dimension.
[`../concepts/commercial-pca-report.md`](../concepts/commercial-pca-report.md)
states the same rule from the feature's side.

⚠️ **No gate enforces this.** There is no `lint:*` entry for it, and no test
asserts that a second `SectionRail` has not appeared. It is held by review and
by this page.

### Severity and defect category are two axes

A finding carries two independent classifications, and collapsing them into one
is the recurring mistake.

**`severity` is how bad it is.** One vocabulary, four words —
`good | marginal | significant | minor` — declared in `app/lib/severity.ts` and
in `server/lib/validations/rating-system.schema.ts`. A rating level carries it;
a canned comment carries it (`comments.severity`); the editor's library filter
matches the two **structurally**, by reading the active level's own `severity`
field (`severityForRatingId` in `app/hooks/useCannedComments.ts`).

> Two details of that are worth keeping. The vocabulary used to be two
> vocabularies for one axis — rating levels said `severity`, comments said a
> locally coined `ratingBucket` (`satisfactory | monitor | defect | na`), and a
> fixed table bridged them. And the matching used to GUESS the severity from
> the level's name, so a workspace that named its levels unconventionally, or
> named them in a language other than English, got no matches and was told
> nothing. Reading the field works for any custom rating system in any
> language. `ratingBucket` and the name-guessing helper are both gone.

**A defect `category` is what kind of thing it is** — whether it belongs in the
report Summary, and who gets dispatched. Categories are tenant rows in
`defect_categories` (`server/lib/db/schema/inspection/defect-category.ts`)
carrying only `name`, `color`, `drivesSummary`, `sortOrder` and `isSeed`, seeded
with three and managed at `/library/defect-categories`. They were a hard-coded
three-value enum, which was a guess about how every inspector files work.

**The two axes deliberately do not map onto each other.** A category has no
severity, and the comment library filters on `severity` alone. "Which severity
is a Safety category?" is exactly the question this split exists to refuse.

⚠️ Three traps here, each paid for once:

- **`DefectCategory` is `string`, not an id type.** `defectDrivesSummary`
  (`server/services/inspection/inspection-report.service.ts`) resolves it by id
  **or** name, because seed template JSON stores a name (`"safety"`) while
  anything authored after the tenant table stores a `defect_categories.id`. An
  unknown or absent category resolves to `drivesSummary: true`: a finding
  nobody classified still reaches the Summary rather than quietly falling out
  of it.
- **`mapRatingSystemLevels` (`server/lib/map-rating-levels.ts`) is the only
  level shape the editor ever sees**, so a field dropped in that mapper does not
  exist as far as the UI is concerned. `pausesAdvance` was dropped there once
  and silently killed the seeds' "stop on a defect so notes actually get
  written" behaviour, with nothing red anywhere. An unrecognised `severity`
  falls back to `minor` rather than throwing, so one stale row cannot take a
  report down.
- **`activeUnitId` defaults to `null`, which resolves the `_default` common
  scope.** Omitting it and passing `null` have to stay identical, or every
  finding key shifts.

## Storage

- **D1**: structured data (tenants, users, inspections, templates, comments, agreements, audit logs, ...)
- **R2**: blobs. **One bucket binding, `PHOTOS`** — field photos, logos, pre-rendered report and certificate PDFs, and e-sign evidence packs all live in it. There is no `REPORTS` bucket; this document named one for a long time and `wrangler.jsonc` has never bound it. Accessed via signed URL or a Worker pass-through endpoint. (A SaaS deployment adds one more, `EXPORTS_BUCKET`, shared with the control plane for offboarding exports.)
- **KV**: two namespaces. `TENANT_CACHE` holds short-lived signed tokens (agent share, password reset), the tenant config and branding caches, cron cursors and rate-limit counters — see [`../concepts/kv-cache.md`](../concepts/kv-cache.md). `OAUTH_KV` is owned by `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` and holds MCP OAuth grants; its binding name is fixed by that library.
- **Queues**: `CRON_QUEUE` (one background job per invocation — see [Background work](#background-work)) and `WORD_EXPORT_QUEUE` (async `.docx` export). Both are declared in `wrangler.jsonc`, producer and consumer, because neither is a SaaS-only feature.
- **Durable Objects**: `INSPECTION_PRESENCE` and `TENANT_PRESENCE` (live presence), `INSPECTION_DOC` (the collaborative results document), `INSPECTOR_MCP` (the remote MCP server).

## Background work

- **Sign-completion workflow** (`server/workflows/`): renders the signed PDF + Certificate of Completion, assembles the evidence pack, and emails the client — see [E-signature](#e-signature-spec-5h). Cloudflare Workflow guarantees retries and persistence across Worker restarts.
- **Cron triggers**: three expressions, declared identically in `wrangler.jsonc` (standalone)
  and `wrangler.saas.jsonc`.

  | Expression | Carries |
  |---|---|
  | `*/5 * * * *` | The main tick. It **probes and enqueues only** — see below. |
  | `0 3 * * *` | Daily R2 usage measurement (`r2-usage`). |
  | `0 4 * * *` | Daily log-table retention sweep (`retention-logs`) and the statutory-form revision watch (`statutory-revision-watch`). |

  Cron Triggers are limited to **5 per account** on the Free plan, which is the budget these
  three are spent from.

### The scheduled path and the 10 ms ceiling

The Workers Free CPU ceiling is **10 ms per invocation**, for cron invocations as much as for
requests. Thirteen background jobs therefore cannot share one `scheduled()` call however fast
each of them is — the only fix is more invocations, not faster jobs.

So the tick does not run jobs. `server/cron/registry.ts` declares each job with a cheap
`probe()` (is there work? — at most a `LIMIT 1` on the job's own due-predicate) and a bounded
`run(cursor)`. `server/cron/dispatch.ts` probes the jobs belonging to the expression that
fired and enqueues one message per job that has work; `server/cron/consumer.ts` runs exactly
one job per queue message, so **each job gets its own invocation with its own budget**. A job
with more work than one batch re-enqueues itself with a cursor rather than looping, because a
loop would put the whole sweep back inside a single invocation and undo the split.

Three properties are load-bearing, and each is held by something executable rather than by
this paragraph:

- **No job body may run on the cron invocation.** `tests/unit/tooling/cron-dispatch.spec.ts`
  asserts it; `npm run lint:cron-budget` gates it.
- **Every job carries a `maxBatch`, and no cron path holds an unbounded table read.** Gated by
  the same script, which prints what it checked next to what it found on every run and treats
  "checked nothing" as a failure.
- **Probe-then-enqueue, not enqueue-always.** The other Free ceiling is Queues at 10,000
  operations/day, shared with the Word-export queue. The five-minute tick fires 288 times a
  day and every message costs two operations (the send and the read), so enqueueing each
  tick-owned job unconditionally would spend roughly `jobs × 576` of that budget a day on
  jobs with nothing to do — 6,912 at the twelve currently on the tick, and the count grows
  with the registry. A single-inspector deployment's ticks are almost all empty, so probing
  first sends almost nothing.

Cursors live in Workers KV (`cron:cursor:<job>`), not in a column — they are bookkeeping, every
paged job is idempotent, and a column would mean a migration in both deployment modes.

⚠️ **The post-refactor CPU numbers have not been measured.** The 138 ms figure above is a real
production reading; the batch sizes in the registry are reasoned starting points, not tuned
ones. Measure a real deployment and tune `maxBatch` down until every invocation sits at or
under **5 ms** — half the ceiling, so growth does not immediately re-break it — before treating
the free-tier claim as re-established.

## Cost model (Cloudflare Free tier)

| Resource | Free limit | Typical inspector usage |
|---|---|---|
| Worker requests | 100k/day | < 1k/day for solo inspector |
| D1 reads | 5M/day | < 100/inspection |
| D1 writes | 100k/day | < 50/inspection |
| R2 storage | 10 GB | ~ 50 MB/inspection |
| R2 Class A ops | 1M/mo | photo writes — < 100/inspection |
| KV reads | 100k/day | < 10/request avg |
| Workflows | 100k/day | one per booking |

A solo inspector doing 50 inspections/month uses approximately 1-2% of Free tier limits. Browser Run (server-side PDF generation) is included on the Free tier with 10 browser-minutes/day — sufficient for typical inspection volume. Wrangler `compatibility_date >= "2026-03-24"` is required to enable the `.quickAction()` API.

## CF Workers constraints

| Resource | Free limit | Worker bundle max |
|---|---|---|
| CPU time | 10ms/request | — |
| Worker bundle | — | 3 MB gzip |
| D1 reads | 5M/day | — |
| R2 storage | 10 GB | — |

⚠️ **The "~1-3ms CPU per request" figure that used to sit here is withdrawn** —
it was an SSR microcost quoted as if it were the whole request. Measured against
a live deployment over seven days of real traffic (2026-09-05): **p50 8ms, p95
49ms, p99 106ms, max 494ms**, and a statutory-form render is ~470ms in workerd
on its own. See [Why React Router v8](#why-react-router-v8) above; that section
is where this number is maintained, and this one repeated a stale copy of it for
long enough to be worth naming.

The combined Worker bundle stays within the size limit. Browser Run (server-side
PDF) is on the Free tier (10 min/day); it requires `compatibility_date >=
"2026-03-24"` and the `browser` binding in `wrangler.jsonc`.
