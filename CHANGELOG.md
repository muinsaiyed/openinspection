## [2.0.0](https://github.com/InspectorHub/OpenInspection/compare/openinspection-v1.0.0...openinspection-v2.0.0) (2026-09-09)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

Three changes in this release alter a database that already holds data, in ways
the upgrade cannot perform for you. **Read
[`docs/operate/upgrade.md`](docs/operate/upgrade.md) before deploying this onto
an existing deployment.** A fresh install is unaffected by all three.

* **The baseline migration was rebuilt twice** — on 2026-08-13, folding in a
  69-file chain, and again on 2026-09-09, folding in the 48-file chain that grew
  after it. Both kept the filename `migrations/0000_baseline.sql`, and
  `wrangler d1 migrations apply` decides what to run by comparing **filenames**
  against your `d1_migrations` table. It never compares contents. So on an
  existing database the upgrade applies nothing, `npm run db:lag` reads "in
  sync", and the deploy proceeds against a schema that did not move. **Every
  tool reports success.** The one-time reconcile is
  [Upgrading across a rebuilt baseline](docs/operate/upgrade.md#upgrading-across-a-rebuilt-baseline);
  do it before `npm run deploy`, not after.
* **Nine columns were retired** by the 2026-08-13 rebuild, and no migration in
  this release can drop them for you, because the forward files that added them
  no longer exist. Six are dead storage and harmless to leave. Three are
  `NOT NULL` with no default, so an insert that omits them fails outright:
  `tenants.name` breaks first-run setup, and `automations.subject_template` and
  `automations.body_template` break automation seeding and every automation
  trigger. Back-fill and retirement statements are in step 5 of the same
  section. Run the back-fill before dropping `tenants.name`: for a workspace
  whose company name was never set, that column is the only name it has.
* **Client signature evidence moved between tables** —
  `agreement_requests.signature_base64` to `agreement_signers.signature_base64`.
  The envelope copy could not say whose signature it was, and is removed. In the
  one case with no recorded author — an envelope signature, several signer rows,
  none holding a signature — the migration **stops before dropping the column**
  and leaves your data as it was. You get a failed migration, not a silent loss.
  Do not resolve it by assigning the signature to a signer you believe is right;
  see the guidance in
  [This release moves signature evidence between tables](docs/operate/upgrade.md#this-release-moves-signature-evidence-between-tables).

### About the completeness of these notes

The sections below are generated by release-please from Conventional Commit
subjects. **146 of the 523 commits in this release do not have one**, so they do
not appear there: a subject like `statutory: …` or
`Capability seam, unified marketplace, … (#309)` is skipped by the parser
entirely. That is also why this release was computed as 1.1.0 and had to be
forced to 2.0.0 — the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer for the first item above is
written correctly, on a commit the parser never reads.

The 17 largest of those 146 are listed here by hand. The remaining 129 are
summarised at the end of this entry.

### Miscellaneous Chores

* release openinspection 2.0.0 ([82f148a](https://github.com/InspectorHub/OpenInspection/commit/82f148ad825fcbbdf3cef80fb88e1990cf51e00b))

### Also in this release

The remaining 129 commits that the generated sections cannot see, by theme:

* **Statutory forms** (17) — read-only declared templates, UTC-midnight calendar
  days, narrowed signature formats placed without stretching, signatures
  resolved by reference rather than by value, and ten authority-printed boxes
  that now read a column somebody fills in.
* **Import and data exchange** (21, across `migration-intake`, `intake`,
  `imports` and `data-exchange`) — one interchange vocabulary owned outside the
  intake registry, contact notes and types carried end to end, a starter
  contacts spreadsheet derived from the importer itself, and a declined run that
  no longer claims to be ready for review.
* **Field census** (9) — classifying the compliance cluster, and replacing four
  recorded reasons that the code contradicted.
* **Retention, legal holds and compliance** (10) — a legal hold now outranks
  every scheduled deletion, the last two undecided tables closed, and the
  manifest's column names bound to the schema so an executor cannot drift from
  what it declares.
* **Conformance gates** (12+) — one registry with a rung that three consumers
  read, every `lint:*` script either on a rung or saying why not, a gate that
  refuses a selection matching nothing, and the rule that a signature may be a
  picture but never a biometric template.
* **AI** (5 + schema) — a managed credential that refreshes itself for
  short-lived-token backends, provenance recording where each call went, and the
  AI subsystem moved off `tenant_configs`, which had no room left.
* **Security** (2) — two publish-gate sanitizer fixes, including one CodeQL was
  right about: a single pass is not a sanitizer, and HTML has two comment
  terminators.
* **Privacy** (1) — the data-portability export was handing back a live second
  factor.
* Plus single fixes across booking, collab, dashboard, hub, media, messages,
  reports, settings and sync. The full list is the commit history between the
  1.0.0 and 2.0.0 tags.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-12

First stable release. Consolidates the work landed since `1.0.0-rc.1`;
grouped by theme rather than one entry per commit.

### Added
- **Commercial PCA reports** — an ASTM E2018-style Property Condition
  Assessment surface: dual-table Cost Engine (Opinion of Cost + Capital
  Replacement Reserve Schedule), tiered light/full reports, per-unit
  inspection, ASTM compliance module (dual sign-off, PSQ, document review),
  editable narrative and reliance text, photo appendix, clickable TOC, and a
  Word (`.docx`) export with a full reserve-schedule year grid.
- **Collaborative inspection editing** — real-time co-editing on Yjs +
  Durable Objects, with version history and offline media upload.
- **Remote MCP server + OAuth 2.1** — a flag-gated Model Context Protocol
  endpoint (tools, resources, prompts) for AI clients.
- **Client portal** — magic-link "My Inspections" + inspection hub, a
  per-inspection shared client documents area, and a client Repair Request
  Builder.
- **Pluggable communications** — bring-your-own email providers (Resend,
  SendGrid, Postmark, Mailgun) and SMS providers (Twilio, Telnyx) behind a
  provider abstraction, with compliance webhooks, a template library,
  connection-test history, and toll-free-verification opt-in handling
  (HELP/OPTOUT/REVOKE, legal links).
- **Report PDF** — paginated print layout, per-tenant PDF settings, and an
  in-editor Preview PDF.
- **Usage metering** — per-tenant metering with a self-service usage view and
  free-tier usage quotas.
- **Inspection detail hub** — consolidated inspection + contact detail views.

### Changed
- Eliminated SSR page-transition lag and added consistent loading states.
- Removed the built-in per-tenant Google Analytics (GA4) tracking.
- MCP extended tier: Resources, Prompts, and UI polish.

### Fixed
- Editor field-readiness, offline queue, and new-inspection wizard fixes.
- Settings persistence: conform-native checkboxes for report/repair-feature
  flags, provider-aware Email/SMS copy, and correct branding read-back.
- M2M tenant upsert keyed on a stable id with slug self-heal.
- Kept the automation cron flush query under D1's 100-column result-set cap.
- Pointed "Switch workspace" links at `/company/switch`.
- UI/endpoint bug batch with nav-skeleton anti-flicker.
- Resolved code-scanning alerts and dependency vulnerabilities (Hono, uuid).

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **High-Fidelity Testing**: Introduced `vitest` and `better-sqlite3` for in-memory, deterministic unit testing of the service layer.
- **Service Mocks**: Created robust simulations for Cloudflare D1 and KV to enable developer-friendly, portable testing.
- **CI/CD Automation**: Integrated unit tests, type-checking, and security audits into GitHub Actions.
- **Structured Logging**: Implemented a JSON-based `Logger` utility for professional observability in production.
- **Governorance Documents**: Added `SECURITY.md` and updated `README.md` with status badges.
- **Multi-Tenant Branding**: Propagated CSS-variable based themeing across all UI components.

### Changed
- Refactored `AuthService` and `AdminService` into standalone, unit-testable classes.
- Migrated testing infrastructure from edge runtime to high-fidelity Node.js environment for improved portability on Windows/macOS.
- Standardized error handling with structured JSON responses.

### Fixed
- Resolved module resolution issues between Cloudflare types and standard Node.js types.
- Fixed logic errors in team-joining and password reset workflows via unit test verification.
