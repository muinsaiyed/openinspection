/**
 * The Notes field's own toolbar: field name, the control that puts library text
 * INTO the field, and the character meter.
 *
 * "Recommended comments" belongs ABOVE the textarea and never inside it (#73).
 * It used to be `absolute right-2 top-2`, floating over the top-right corner of
 * the box — and a textarea cannot indent only its first line, so the moment
 * line one reached the right edge the control sat on top of the inspector's own
 * words. That was occasional until AI "Improve wording" started returning full
 * paragraphs; then it was every note. No CSS fixes it, because the collision is
 * in the information architecture: a control that inserts text was being
 * rendered as an ornament on the text.
 *
 * Below the field was not free either — that space belongs to `AiAssistPanel`,
 * whose draft slab needs the full width to be read against the note above it.
 * Above is also the honest read: this affordance acts on the field, so it sits
 * at the same rank as the field's own label.
 *
 * Placement is pinned structurally by `item-editor-notes-toolbar.test.tsx`,
 * because one box covering another is invisible to type-check, eslint and
 * `lint:ds` alike — only a browser can see it, and only with a long enough
 * first line.
