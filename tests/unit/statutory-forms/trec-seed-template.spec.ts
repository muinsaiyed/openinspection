/**
 * The template that produces the Texas form, against the map of that form.
 *
 * -- WHY THIS EXISTS ---------------------------------------------------------
 * The template this replaced looked like a TREC template and was not one. It
 * carried 28 items where the Commission's form has 41 lettered sections: Walls
 * and Doors were each split in two where the form has one, Gas Distribution sat
 * under Optional Systems where the form puts it under Plumbing, and thirteen
 * sections were simply absent. Nothing was red. Every gate passed, and the only
 * observable symptom would have been an inspector pressing a button and getting
 * a document with thirteen blank sections on it.
 *
 * So these assertions are about CORRESPONDENCE, which is the property that went
 * missing silently: every binding names a field the form actually has, every
 * binding names an item this template actually contains, and the rating a
 * template stores is spelled the way the map expects to read it.
