/**
 * Polls the authority's page for each published statutory form and RECORDS what

 *
 * ── The one line of this file that matters ──────────────────────────────────
 * It never touches `statutory_form_versions`. A watcher that only reports costs
 * nothing on the day it misses a revision; one that replaces sends an inspector
 * a statutory form the state did not ask for, which they sign and file. That
 * asymmetry is why the write below goes to a different table with a different
 * shape — `statutory_form_sightings` cannot express an effective date or a
 * publisher, so nothing read out of it can be selected for rendering.
 *
 * ── Failure is per target, and is never silence ─────────────────────────────
 * An agency page is somebody else's server: it times out, it 404s after a site
 * rebuild, it serves an HTML error page with a 200. None of that may take the
 * scheduled invocation down, and none of it may look like "unchanged" either —
 * a poll that failed writes no sighting and logs the reason, so a page nobody
 * has successfully read for a month shows up as a `last_seen_at` that stopped
 * moving rather than as a run of reassuring rows.
