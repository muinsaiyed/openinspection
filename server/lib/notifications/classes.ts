/**
 * The notification CLASS vocabulary — one id per kind of notification we send,
 * and the single answer to "may this be switched off at all?".
 *
 * Two different surfaces were already asking that question and neither could
 * see the other:
 *
 * - the OPERATOR axis — `renderer.ts` reads `descriptor.required` to decide
 *   whether a tenant may disable a template for everybody
 * - the RECIPIENT axis — the preferences screen, which is why this file exists
 *
 * They are the same underlying question. A notification that must reach someone
 * for legal or operational reasons must not be suppressible by EITHER party, so
 * there is one flag and both read it. Keeping them separate would let a tenant
 * disable the password-reset email that a recipient is told is "always sent".
 *
 * `required: true` means: switching this off locks the recipient out of their
 * account, hides money they owe or are owed, or destroys their only copy of
 * something they signed. It is not a synonym for "important".
 *
 * One more case earns it, found while converting the hand-built sends: a
 * ONE-OFF transmission the sender explicitly asked for, to an address they
 * typed, where the recipient has no account and no ongoing relationship with
 * us. A preference is a standing choice about a stream; a single share is not a
 * stream, so there is no preference to express and nowhere to store one. The
 * only thing "suppressible" could mean there is the operator switch — which
 * would make a send button report success and do nothing.
 *
 * `classes.test.ts` is where the authority for each value lives, and it makes
 * that authority executable: every class must be placed
 * in one of two explicit lists, so a new notification cannot be added without
 * someone deciding which it is.
