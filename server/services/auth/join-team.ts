/**
 * Joins a team using an invitation token.
 *
 * Post-multi-workspace: same email can already exist in another
 * tenant — we only reject when it already exists within THIS tenant.
 * UNIQUE(tenant_id, email) at the DB layer is the hard backstop (the
 * unique index is partial — `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` — so it only
 * guards active rows).
 *
 * A soft-deleted row for this (tenantId, email) — i.e. a previously
 * removed member (TeamService.removeMember) — is REACTIVATED in place
 * rather than inserted as a new row: `deletedAt` is cleared and the
 * invited role/credentials are applied. This reattaches the member's
 * inspection history under their original id and avoids a UNIQUE(email)
 * conflict with the still-present soft-deleted row.
 *
 * ── The account and its acceptance are ONE write ────────────────────────
 * The invariant is enforced strictly:
 * the member row and the `account_acceptances` rows go into a single
 * `db.batch()`, D1's only atomic primitive. An acceptance written after the
 * account — even microseconds after, even durably enqueued — leaves the
 * state `account = EXISTS, acceptance_ledger = ABSENT` in between, which is
 * the state this design refuses.
 *
 * REACTIVATION OWES ONE TOO. It is tempting to treat it as "they already
 * accepted", and the row itself says otherwise: the code below already
 * resets TOTP enrollment because "the invited person accepting this invite
 * may be a different individual than whoever previously held this row". The
 * same sentence answers this question. What is skipped is only the exact
 * `(doc, version)` pairs already on record — see `invite-acceptance.ts`.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT CAN NOW REFUSE. A tenant that has never published its Privacy and
 * Terms has nothing for the invited member to accept, and the join fails
 * rather than creating an account with an empty ledger. Publishing happens
 * when an admin saves that text in Settings, so a workspace that never
 * touched those fields cannot take on members until it does. That is the
 * fail-closed direction and it is a real product consequence, not a
 * theoretical one.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT REFUSES AT THE CAP TOO. `requireSeatAvailable` on POST /team/invite
 * reserves the seat when the invitation is written, but the seat is only
 * actually taken here — and an invitation can outlive the reservation that
 * let it be written. The cap is therefore checked again at the moment it
 * moves, before anything is written, for BOTH branches: reactivation clears
 * `deleted_at`, which is precisely what makes the row countable again. The
 * invitation being redeemed is excluded from that count, since it is itself
 * one of the reservations being tested against.
