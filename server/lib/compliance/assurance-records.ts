/**
 * The read side of the three append-only assurance ledgers.
 *
 * WHY ONE MODULE FOR THREE TABLES. `tenant_destruction_records`,
 * `ai_call_provenance` and `ai_content_reviews` were each written by exactly one
 * call site and read by nothing. Three write-only ledgers is not three bugs, it
 * is one: nobody decided WHO would ever ask. So the retrieval rules are decided
 * once, here, and the HTTP layers above are thin — they choose a reader and a
 * guard, and they add nothing to the shape.
 *
 * THE RULES, AND THEY HOLD FOR ALL THREE.
 *   - READ-ONLY. Nothing in this file writes, updates or deletes. An audit
 *     record a reader can edit is not evidence of anything, so the module that
 *     serves it must not be able to change it.
 *   - EXPLICIT COLUMN PROJECTION, never `select()`. A column added to one of
 *     these tables later must be exposed deliberately — on `ai_call_provenance`
 *     that is a compliance decision (see the schema comment forbidding prompt
 *     text), and a `SELECT *` would publish it the day it lands.
 *   - EPOCH MILLISECONDS on the way out. D1 hands back Date | number | string
 *     depending on driver; callers get a number.
 *   - NEWEST FIRST, CAPPED, AND PAGEABLE BACKWARDS. A compliance request is
 *     answered from the recent end and walked back; an uncapped read of a ledger
 *     that grows per AI call is not a read path, it is an outage.
 *
 * THE TENANT FILTER IS NOT UNIFORM, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN PROBLEM.
 * The two AI ledgers are ordinary tenant-scoped tables and are filtered by
 * `tenantId` like everything else. `tenant_destruction_records` is the durable
 * proof that a tenant was destroyed: it OUTLIVES the row it names, is excluded
 * from `tenantScopedTables()` for that reason, and therefore can never be
 * reached by a query that derives its tenant from a session belonging to that
 * tenant. Its reader is the platform operator and its filter is an argument.
 * See `readDestructionRecords` below. Its two callers are the admin AI-assurance
 * route and the portal integration route; both are found by grepping for the
 * function name, which is what a reader wants anyway.
 *
 * Their paths are deliberately NOT spelled out here. `tests/unit/sync/
 * portal-isolation.spec.ts` enforces the portal module boundary with `git grep`
 * over `server/`, and git grep has no AST — a path named in prose reads exactly
 * like an import, and this comment failed that gate on the way in.
