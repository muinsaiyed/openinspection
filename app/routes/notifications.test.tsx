/**
 * The staff alert centre has to actually say what happened (IA-112).
 *
 * It rendered `notification.message`, a field that exists nowhere — not in the
 * DTO, not in the schema. Every row was an empty paragraph above a relative
 * timestamp, so the page that is meant to carry "new booking", "report ready"
 * and "new message" showed a list of times and nothing else. It compiled because
 * the payload was typed `unknown[]` and read through
 * `as Record<string, string>`, which will hand you `undefined` for any name you
 * ask for.
 *
 * So the first test asserts the content, and would have failed on the old code
 * for the right reason. The last one covers the other half: a failed fetch used
 * to be caught into an empty array, which rendered the "no notifications yet"
 * empty state — a lookup failure presented as a confident answer.
