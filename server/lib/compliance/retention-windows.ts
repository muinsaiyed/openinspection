 * OI #276 — the retention WINDOWS: one constant per clock, and the reason for it.
 *
 * Split out of `retention-manifest.ts` when that file crossed the size gate.
 * The split is along a real seam rather than an arbitrary line count: this file
 * answers HOW LONG and WHY, the manifest answers WHICH TABLES and WHAT ACTION,
 * and `retention-logs.ts` answers HOW. `check-retention-manifest.mjs` reads the
 * manifest's arrays as source text and only ever parses `window.unit`, never the
 * numeric value, so moving the numbers here changes nothing it can see.
 *
 * ── One constant per number, and the name says what it moves ────────────────
 * An earlier draft had a single `OPERATIONAL_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` covering every
 * table. It was withdrawn: storage limitation asks for a period PER PURPOSE, and
 * a dedup ledger and a PII-bearing audit trail are not one purpose. A shared
 * constant is also the shape in which editing one value silently moves two
 * unrelated clocks. These numbers are published in the privacy policy, so each
 * is named after the thing it governs and moving it shows in the diff as the
 * specific clock it is.
 *
 * The single documented exception is `AI_ASSURANCE_RETENTION_MONTHS`, which two
 * tables share BECAUSE they must never diverge — see the note on it.

 * store's TTL is 24 hours and its schema says a retry older than that "is a
 * different problem". Deleting a `done` row means a later replay of the same
 * key RE-EXECUTES the mutation, so the window must clear any legitimate retry:
 * a week is seven full TTLs of margin, enough for a client re-driving a queued
 * intent after a weekend outage, and short enough that a verbatim API response
 * body — whatever PII that endpoint returned — is not kept for a quarter.
