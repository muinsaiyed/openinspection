/**
 * An agent is a third party, and now signs something that says so — once, for the
 * whole deployment.
 *
 * The shape of the problem: an agent is a `users` row with `tenant_id IS NULL`, a
 * global identity with no company behind it, so neither a tenant's Privacy URL nor
 * a company's contract governs them, and the signup path used to accept
 * `termsAccepted: undefined` and write NULL.
 *
 * ── What changed, and why this file was rewritten ────────────────────────────
 * The first implementation put the document in `tenant_legal_versions`, reasoning
 * that in standalone the operator IS the single tenant. That reasoning worked in
 * standalone and broke SaaS outright: the lookup went through
 * `profile.fixedTenantId`, which is null there, so every SaaS agent signup was
 * refused for a reason having nothing to do with the caller.
 *
 * The underlying question is settled — ONE acceptance covers the
 * whole deployment, so the ledger is `agent × terms version` and never
 * `agent × company × terms version`. That makes the document tenant-less, which
 * removes the mode branch rather than parameterising it. `deployment_legal_versions`
 * is the store; `agent_terms` has been REMOVED from the tenant enum so nobody
 * re-wires the old way and is right to think it was intended.
 *
 * ── What the acceptance has to carry, and why a URL is not it ────────────────
 * The old shape held `termsUrl` and `privacyUrl`. A URL records where the text
 * WAS, not what it SAID — the page behind it can be edited, and then the
 * acceptance points at something the signer never read. Version plus content hash
 * is the only pair that survives the text changing.
 *
 * ── What ships versus what goes live ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The store, the acceptance shape, the fail-closed signup and the publish path
 * ship. GOING LIVE gates on APPROVED text, and the current draft is not it,
 * which is why nothing below asserts any particular
 * wording — and why `agent-terms:publish` refuses a body that still carries
 * placeholders.
