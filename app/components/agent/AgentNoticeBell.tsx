/**
 * The agent portal's Notices bell, wired.
 *
 * Same shared <NoticeBell> the client Hub uses — after C1 a notice is one
 * entity regardless of who reads it (design §3.11), so a second component
 * would only be a copy waiting to drift. Two honest differences, both props:
 *
 *  - Rows name the sending COMPANY. An agent's inbox spans every company that
 *    has them as a contact, so "who sent this" is information the client's
 *    single-company inbox does not need.
 *  - No email remedy. It opens a message composer, and the agent portal has
 *    none yet (Track D). A button with nothing behind it is worse than the
 *    plain "Not delivered" the reader gets instead.
