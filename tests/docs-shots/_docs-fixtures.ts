/**
 * Fixtures the CAPTURE run needs and the shared seed deliberately does not have.
 *
 * `tests/seed-fixtures.ts` creates inspections with `template_id` NULL — its
 * comment says so in as many words, because the specs that use it exercise the
 * editor's no-template fallback. The user guide documents the opposite path:
 * the wizard refuses to leave its first step without a template, so a capture
 * run against that seed alone photographs a form nobody can advance. (The first
 * committed version of `create-an-inspection.shots.ts` did exactly that, and
 * could never have produced its pictures.)
 *
 * So the captures create what they need, THROUGH THE API, and only what the
 * pictures require. Not through the seed: adding a template there would change
 * the fixture every E2E spec shares, to serve a documentation build.
 *
 * Everything created here is plainly fictional and lives on the fixture tenant.
 * The screenshots are of the product, not of the data — but the data is what a
 * reader sees, so it has to look like a real inspection rather than like
 * "test test test".
