/**
 * The QuickBooks CDC cron, on both deployment shapes.
 *
 * `runQBOCDC` had never been imported by a test — it was a module-private
 * function, which is the mechanical reason it had zero coverage. Inside that
 * gap it resolved credentials ONCE from `env`, before its per-tenant loop, and
 * cron has no Hono middleware to merge a tenant's encrypted secrets. So on a
 * `qboAppManaged: false` deployment — where the settings form is the ONLY place
 * an operator can put a credential — the sweep read nothing, logged
 * `QBO not configured`, and returned. The browser flow worked, Settings read
 * "Active", and inbound reconciliation had never run once.
 *
 * Nothing about the credential path is stubbed. The fixture seals a real
 * `secrets_enc` with the product's own `sealSecrets`, and this spec reads it
 * back through the real `loadTenantSecrets` and the real
 * `applyIntegrationSecrets`. Stubbing either would leave the last spec here
 * asserting a precedence rule against a mock of that same rule — and the
 * precedence is the whole point: QuickBooks keys are not in
 * `TENANT_OWNED_KEYS`, so env must keep winning over the tenant row.
