/**
 * The portal-route gate: no hosted-service URL may appear as a bare path in
 * this repository's markdown.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-no-portal-routes.mjs
 *
 * Why, what counts as a hit, and what does not, all live in
 * `scripts/lib/no-portal-routes.mjs` beside the pattern they describe. The
 * short version: this engine is AGPL and self-hosted by other people, a hosted
 * screen is not reachable in their deployment, and `/company/acme/team` in
 * prose is a promise this software cannot keep. Link to it absolutely
 * (`https://inspectorhub.io/…`) and it is fine.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS GATE GREPS PROSE, so it can be right about the words and wrong about
 * the meaning. The usual case is a NEGATIVE statement — explaining that we
 * deliberately do not document a hosted screen requires naming it — and a
 * content grep cannot tell that from an instruction. Two escape hatches, both
 * requiring a reason:
 *
 *     <!-- no-portal-routes-allow: <reason> -->        that line only
 *     <!-- no-portal-routes-allow-file: <reason> -->   the whole file
 *
 * Both numbers print on every run: files scanned and hits found. Zero files
 * scanned is a FAILURE — it means the pathspec is broken, not that the docs are
 * clean, and a gate that reports success for the condition it exists to detect
 * is worse than no gate. Zero HITS is the intended steady state and is printed
 * as such, so a green run is legible rather than merely silent.
