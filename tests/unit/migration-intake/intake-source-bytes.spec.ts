/**
 * The size gate measures the file, and picks its cap by what the file is.
 *
 * The defect this guards: the gate used to measure a UTF-8 re-encoding of a
 * decoded upload. Every byte that did not survive the decode became a
 * three-byte replacement character, so a legitimate binary export was inflated
 * and could be refused as oversized — with a message telling the operator to
 * split a file that was never too large.
