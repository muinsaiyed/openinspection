 * Snapshot the selected services onto an inspection as `inspection_services`
 * rows — tier 2 of the money-authority chain that `getEffectivePriceCents()`
 * reads (`server/lib/effective-price.ts`). An inspection with no rows here has
 * no tier-2 authority at all, so its price falls through to `inspections.price`,
 * the cache the schema rules forbid treating as authority. Pay splits attach to
 * these lines too, so an order without them has nothing to split.
 *
 * Snapshots, not references: `nameSnapshot` / `priceSnapshot` freeze what the
 * catalog said on the day, so editing a service later never rewrites history.
 *
 * `serviceSelections` (IA-1 superset) takes precedence over the legacy flat
 * `serviceIds` list when both are present — the handlers already merge them so
 * only one branch ever fires.
 *
 * UNKNOWN IDS ARE SKIPPED, NOT AN ERROR. That is the dashboard wizard's
 * contract, preserved here byte for byte. It is deliberately NOT the contract
 * of `attachHoldServices` (`server/services/concierge/hold-inputs.ts`), which
 * throws on an unknown id because a hold that silently drops a service
 * under-quotes the client. Two contracts, two functions — do not merge them.
 *
 * CALLERS. `InspectionCoreService.createInspection` (the dashboard wizard) is
 * the only one today. The PUBLIC BOOKING PATH DOES NOT CALL THIS YET and so
 * still produces orders with no tier-2 authority.
 * The two candidate call sites are `BookingService.fulfillBooking`'s
 * direct-insert branch and `InspectionRequestService.create` (which owns the
 * multi-service branch's inspections); wiring exactly one of them — not both,
 * or a booking's lines get written twice — belongs to booking-deposit (#20),
 * together with the invoice-total change that turning tier 2 on implies.
