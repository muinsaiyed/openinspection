/**
 * Raw-SQL seeder conformance gate.
 *
 * The seeders under `tests/` and `scripts/` talk to D1 in raw SQL strings, so
 * nothing type-checks them. When a column is renamed or dropped they keep
 * compiling, keep linting, and keep passing both unit suites — they fail only
 * when a real database rejects the statement, which for `tests/seed-fixtures.ts`
 * means the e2e globalSetup on CI, several minutes and one push later.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. Removing `tenants.name` left FOUR raw-SQL seeders
 * still writing it, and the compiler saw none of them:
 *
 *   tests/seed-fixtures.ts          three inserts — found by CI, after a push
 *   scripts/seed-test-user.mjs      would fail on next use
 *   scripts/seed-pca-demo.mjs       would fail on next use — it has since been
 *                                   retired, its data shape moved into
 *                                   tests/seed-fixtures.ts behind SEED_PCA=1
 *   scripts/lib/cloudflare-db.js    the CLI self-host setup path — and it was
 *                                   ALSO still writing `subdomain`, a column
 *                                   that had been gone far longer, so the first
 *                                   command a self-hoster ran had been failing
 *                                   with nobody upstream of them noticing
 *
 * The last one is the argument for this gate existing at pre-commit rather than
 * in CI: a seeder nothing runs automatically has no other rung that can ever
 * report it. It rots silently until a human hits it.
 *
 * Two rules, both aimed at that failure mode:
 *
 *   1. Every column named in a raw `INSERT INTO <t> (...)` or
 *      `UPDATE <t> SET col =` must exist on `<t>` in server/lib/db/schema.
 *      Unknown table -> skipped (D1 internals, portal-side tables).
 *   2. A file that writes a `timestamp_ms` column must not compute seconds
 *      (`Date.now() / 1000`). Drizzle stores milliseconds; seeding seconds is
 *      accepted silently by SQLite and renders as 1970.
 *
 * Escape hatch: `seed-lint-ok: <reason>` on the offending line.
 *
 * Ported from the portal repo, which grew it after `tenants.status` was dropped
 * out from under both of its seeders. Same defect, different column, one repo
 * later — which is the whole reason it is here now.
 *
 * console.* is intentional — this is a build script, not server code.

 * a second time. Its data shape now lives in `tests/seed-fixtures.ts` behind
 * `SEED_PCA=1`, which e2e globalSetup runs and this gate reads. That is the
 * shape of every fix here worth having: move the SQL somewhere watched, do not
 * annotate it where it is not.

 * The count is printed on every run, including green ones: a frozen violation
 * that stops being visible is just a violation.
