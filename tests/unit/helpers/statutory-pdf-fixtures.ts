/**
 * Two PDFs, built here rather than committed.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO OFFICIAL FORM IS IN THIS REPOSITORY, and these fixtures are not
 * stand-ins for one. A government agency's published form is that agency's
 * document; it is not automatically free of copyright, and this repository does
 * not carry one. The bytes an operator publishes live in object storage, keyed
 * and hashed (`statutory_form_versions.object_key`).
 *
 * What the fixtures reproduce is the SHAPE these forms come in, which is what
 * the code has to handle:
 *
 *   `buildFieldedPdf()` — an AcroForm with named text fields, where values are
 *   set by field name. Real examples of this shape carry hand-typed names that
 *   mean nothing (`Text1`, `1`) and sometimes carry a typo, which is the whole
 *   reason a map is bound to one revision's hash.
 *
 *   `buildFlatPdf()` — no `/AcroForm`, no widgets, no annotations at all: a
 *   print-out of a word processor document. Every value on one of these has to
 *   be drawn at measured coordinates, so a validator that required form fields
 *   would reject it outright.
 *
 * Both return their own sha256, because every check in this subsystem is
 * against the hash of the exact bytes rather than a file name.
