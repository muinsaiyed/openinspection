/**
 * The §2 inventory, made executable.
 *
 * A spec table and a code constant that are meant to agree, but are only asked
 * to agree by prose, will drift — `settings-automations.test.ts` was written
 * days ago for exactly this failure, after a channel was added to the schema
 * and the route's filter silently dropped it.
 *
 * So three couplings are asserted here rather than described:
 *
 *  1. every email template the code can send has a class
 *  2. the OPERATOR's kill switch (`descriptor.required`, read by renderer.ts)
 *     and the RECIPIENT's kill switch (`class.required`) agree — otherwise a
 *     tenant could disable a notification the screen promises is always sent
 *  3. every class is placed in one of the two lists below, so adding a
 *     notification without deciding whether it may be muted FAILS
 *
 * (3) is the one that matters over time. (1) and (2) catch today's mistakes;
 * (3) catches the ones nobody has made yet.
