 * IA-87 ② — the card showed an amount it could not change. The money authority
 * chain is invoice > Σ service lines > `inspections.price`, so the editable
 * thing depends on which tier is in force: with service lines booked, the
 * Services card owns the figure and this card says so; without them, the base
 * price is what gets billed, and it is editable here. Offering a "set price"
 * box that silently loses to a service line would be worse than not offering
 * one, which is roughly what the report editor's settings sheet was doing.
