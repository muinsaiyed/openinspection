 *
 * ── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Apply used to write `expiryFor(false, finishedAt)` outright, and a reset that
 * cannot be exceeded is not a window, it is an extension. An assisted run holds
 * a ninety-day clock from upload; the staff delivery moves it to `staged`
 * without touching that clock; an apply on day eighty-nine then wrote a fresh
 * thirty days, and the uploaded file — a third party's name, email address and
 * phone number, which apply does not rewrite — lived to day one hundred and
 * nineteen under a rule declaring ninety.
 *
 * That is not a documentation mismatch, and correcting the prose would not have
 * addressed it: a retention control that does not enforce its own declared
 * limit is not a control. The declared limit is what the catalogue publishes
 * for this table, so the limit is what the code has to hold to.
 *
 * ── The invariant, and why the clamp is against the CREATION date ────────────
 * What must hold is that APPLY CANNOT EXTEND THE ORIGINAL COLLECTION-TO-ERASURE
 * OUTER BOUND BEYOND THE DECLARED MAXIMUM. Several implementations reach that.
 *
 * The obvious one — `min(30 days from apply, existing due date)` — reaches it by
 * never moving the date at all, and in doing so reintroduces the exact defect
 * the reset was written to fix: a run applied on day twenty-nine gets a one-day
 * undo. It also over-delivers, holding an APPLIED staged run to thirty days when
 * the period declared for this table is ninety and nothing ever promised the
 * shorter one would survive the apply.
 *
 * Clamping to creation-plus-the-declared-window satisfies the invariant exactly
 * — no run outlives its own upload by more than the declared period, on any
 * path — while leaving a full undo window everywhere it fits. Recorded here
 * rather than in a plan, because a later reader who reaches for the obvious
 * formula must be able to see that the difference was decided, not missed.
