/**
 * Write our values onto the authority's own PDF. The output IS their document.
 *
 * ── Why not lay the form out ourselves ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The requirement a statutory form has to meet is not "looks like the official
 * form": it is text verbatim, spacing identical, borders identical, placement
 * identical. Rebuilding the layout — in HTML through a browser renderer, or in
 * drawing calls here — can only ever approach that, and the gap is invisible
 * from the inside. A rebuilt form passes every assertion about its own values
 * and prints something the agency did not publish.
 *
 * So the agency's file is the substrate. We load it, put values into the places
 * a person measured, and save. Identity with the published document is then
 * structural rather than something we keep achieving, and it is measurable:
 * `tests/unit/statutory-forms/render.spec.ts` digests every page's content
 * stream before and after and requires the untouched ones to be byte-identical.
 *
 * ── Two ways in, because official forms come in two shapes ──────────────────
 * A fillable form takes values through its named fields; a form that is a word
 * processor print-out has no fields at all and takes them as text drawn at
 * measured coordinates. Both are `pdf-lib`, which is already a runtime
 * dependency here.
 *
 * ⚠️ A value with no route onto the page is REFUSED, never dropped. A dropped
 * value is a blank on a statutory document, and a blank looks exactly like an
 * answer nobody had. Likewise a required field with no answer in `values`: a
 * form nobody filled must not be producible, while an OPTIONAL box filled with
 * an empty answer must be. For a required field the two cases collapse — an
 * absent key and an empty one both print the same blank, and `requiredFields`
 * is the map's statement that no inspection may leave this box blank.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT DISTINCTION CAN LIVE. Measured against the
 * format: a form field set to an empty string is stored by storing nothing, so
 * it reads back identically to one that was never set. No later reader of the
 * document can tell the two apart. The refusal below happens before a document
 * exists, which is why it is a refusal and not a warning.
 *
 * ⚠️ A NAMED FIELD IS SET AS THE KIND IT IS. `acroform` sets a text field and
 * `acroform_checkbox` sets a `/Btn` widget; each refuses a field of the other
 * kind rather than guessing, because guessing sets nothing and raises nothing.
 *
 * That second route exists because of what the Texas form turned out to be: 245
 * fields, 81 text and 164 real checkbox widgets. A map that DRAWS a mark at a
 * coordinate inside one of those produces a document that is right on paper and
 * wrong in its data — every box still reads as unticked to anything that opens
 * the file, and the widget's own off-state appearance is painted after page
 * content and may cover the mark outright.
 *
 * ── A question with several boxes may have several of them ticked ───────────
 * An answer is a string OR a list of options. A string marks the one box it
 * names, exactly as it always has; a list marks every box it names, which is
 * what a multi-select question on these forms actually is — 6 boxes for the
 * Citizens photo requirements, 13 for electrical hazards, 8 for wiring types, 8
 * for pipe types, 8 for roof damage signs, 7 for the 1802's roof coverings.
 *
 * The two refusals that go with it are in `refuseAnswersNoBoxCanTake`, and both
 * exist because the alternative prints and looks filled: an empty list (which is
 * the empty string's job, and is what a binding that resolved nothing yields),
 * and a list reaching a mapping that writes text.
 *
 * ── A value too big for its space is refused, never made to look like it fit ──
 * The two routes fail in mirror image and both leave a document that LOOKS
 * filled. Drawn text wraps downward with no height bound, so a long answer runs
 * over the row beneath it; a form field clips whatever its widget cannot show.
 * On the two forms measured, 47 of 72 overlay rows and 47 of 48 have room for a
 * single line, so this is the ordinary case rather than the edge one.
 *
 * So a value is fitted, then shrunk to a floor the map declares, and then
 * refused. The measuring, and the reasoning behind refusing rather than
 * truncating, live in `fit.ts`.
