/**
 * <ReportDeliveryList> — "did the report reach them, and did they open it?"
 * (OI #271, LIA condition 6).
 *
 * Sits at the head of the Outbox, because that is the block an inspector opens
 * when asking the question, and because condition 6 requires "opened" to be
 * PAIRED with delivery status rather than shown on its own. The Outbox rows
 * below carry the reason for anything that failed or was skipped; this list
 * carries the shorter answer.
 *
 * ## Three states, and why the third is not a nicety
 *
 *   queued    → "Scheduled to send <when>" and NO open status, because none is
 *               possible. The automation ledger hides future-dated rows (a
 *               "pending" row dated tomorrow reads as a failure), so without
 *               this state a scheduled notice would render as "not yet opened"
 *               and send the inspector after a client who was never written to.
 *   delivered → "Delivered <when> · not yet opened" — the two facts in one
 *               line, in that order, so neither can be read without the other.
 *   opened    → the counters, as counters.
 *
 * ## Two things this component must never become
 *
 *  1. **Proof.** LIA §3.4(a): the human filter is a heuristic, and a determined
 *     mail-security scanner issuing a plain `GET` is indistinguishable from a
 *     reader. The caveat renders whenever an open does. The remedy for the
 *     false-positive rate is NOT client-side confirmation — that would move the
 *     lawful basis from legitimate interests to consent.
 *  2. **A dashboard.** No chart, no trend, no "engagement", no ranking of
 *     recipients. The LIA's purpose test passes for the delivery question and
 *     explicitly for nothing else, and a visualisation is a different purpose
 *     that would need its own assessment. The co-located test asserts the
 *     absence of an `<svg>` for exactly this reason.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * One line per RECIPIENT, never per deliverable. `report_views` carries no
 * `report_id` on purpose (LIA §3.4(b)): the public renderer has no report
 * identity, so hanging an order-scoped open off "the radon report" would
 * manufacture a false statement about an identified person — the one thing
 * §3.4(b) rejects outright. That is also why this list does not live on
 * <ReportsCard>, which is the per-deliverable surface.
 *
 * lint:ds — only `ih-*` design tokens; raw Tailwind colors are forbidden.
