/**
 * What the report has to carry so the later steps have something to ask about.
 *
 * The batch stores ROWS, and rows are the mapping's OUTPUT — they cannot be
 * read backwards into the mapping that produced them. So the report re-reads
 * the stored file and re-derives both the columns and the starting mapping
 * every time it is built. Re-derived rather than remembered: a reopened run
 * then shows the file's real columns instead of a snapshot that may no longer
 * describe it.
 *
 * The consequence is asserted in BOTH directions from ONE fixture, because
 * "null after the file was cleared" on its own is indistinguishable from a
 * field that is always null. The same batch reports real columns while its file
 * is stored and nothing once it is gone — and nothing is the right answer, not
 * an edge case: with no file there is no mapping left to change, so the step
 * disappears rather than rendering a control that can alter nothing.
