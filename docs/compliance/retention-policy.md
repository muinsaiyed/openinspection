# Retention policy — versions, and why each number is the number

The retention catalogue lives in code: `server/lib/compliance/retention-manifest.ts`
holds WHICH tables and WHAT action, `retention-windows.ts` holds HOW LONG and
why, and `retention-policy.ts` carries the version header and a digest of the
operative fields. `npm run lint:retention-policy` refuses a build where the
rules moved and the header did not — a window edited on its own, shipped, and
noticed by nobody is the case that gate exists to remove.

This file is the other half: every period has to be answerable with one page
saying why this number and not another, and a digest cannot say that.

> **Where this file lives.** The reasoning behind each window is recorded here,
> beside [`destruction-evidence.md`](destruction-evidence.md), and nowhere else
> that this repository can reach. Nothing in this file is privileged; it states
> which periods apply and the public basis for each.

## Status

`approved_with_conditions`. The windows have been reviewed and the conditions
attached to that review are named in `retention-policy.ts` — two of five remain
unmet, both on the customer Terms publish rather than on any period here. The
status is deliberately not `approved`: a reader who sees that word stops asking
what is left.

## 2026-08-19.3 — a legal hold now outranks every scheduled deletion

**What changed.** Every rule in the manifest gained a required `legalHold`
classification, and the sweeps learned to obey it. Twelve rules are
`tenant_scoped` — their executors exclude rows belonging to a tenant with an
unreleased row in the new `legal_holds` table. Two are `suspend_all`
(`sync_outbox`, `parked_cmd_events`): those tables carry a command or account
payload with the tenant identity inside a JSON blob, so there is nothing to
filter on and the whole rule stands down while any hold is in force. Three are
`not_applicable`, each with a written reason. The agreement sweep — a separate
clock that destroys a signature and three R2 artefacts — honours holds too.

**Why a hold covers a tenant rather than a list of rows.** A narrow hold has to
enumerate what it covers before anyone knows what the matter will need, and
every record it failed to name is then deleted on schedule while a hold is
nominally in force. That is the worst available outcome, because the hold's
existence is what makes the deletion look considered. Over-preservation under a
recorded hold is defensible; under-preservation is spoliation.

**Why a failed read stops the sweep.** `loadActiveHolds` throws rather than
returning nothing, and neither sweep catches it. An unreadable holds table looks
exactly like a table with no holds in it, and the difference between those two
readings is whether the night's deletions happened during a preservation order.
A sweep that skips a night is recoverable.

**Why the classification is checked against the schema.** `lint:retention`
rejects a rule claiming `tenant_scoped` on a table with no `tenant_id` column,
and one claiming anything else on a table that has one. The first would delete
under a hold; the second over-preserves for no reason, which is invisible
because over-preservation looks like nothing happening. The gate also fails when
zero rules are `tenant_scoped` — every table could be classified and the
invariant still enforced nowhere, which is what this file described one version
ago and it printed OK then too.

**What this deliberately does not do.** A hold suspends *scheduled* deletion. It
does not touch the DSAR erasure path, where a preservation obligation and an
erasure request point in opposite directions; that conflict is a legal judgement
with notification duties attached, not a filter, and wiring it silently either
way would have decided it in a WHERE clause. Placing a hold is also a database
write with no endpoint and no screen behind it — deliberate for a rare,
legally-directed event, and stated here rather than left to be discovered.

## 2026-08-19.2 — the two pending tables close, and an earlier call is withdrawn

**What changed.** `notifications` and `qbo_sync_errors` were the last two rules with
no decision. Both now have one, and part of the 2026-08-19.1 decision below is
withdrawn.

| Rule | Now | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `notifications` | **24 months from `created_at`** | The inbox, not the record that a communication happened — `automation_logs` answers that and is kept by design. Anchoring on `read_at`/`archived_at` was explicitly rejected: an unread notice would become immortal, which turns a UI-state field into a retention control |
| `qbo_sync_errors` | **90 days after RESOLUTION**; unresolved never age out | An unresolved failure is outstanding work, not a record of work. "A sync failure that remains unresolved for a year should not disappear merely because it is old" |

**A column had to be added to implement it faithfully.** There was no
`resolved_at` — only `is_resolved` and `updated_at` — and `updated_at` moves on
re-detection too, so it says when the row was last touched rather than when it
stopped being outstanding. Using it would have been an inference dressed as a
timestamp. Rows resolved before the column existed have a NULL anchor and are never
swept: an unknown resolution date fails closed.

**No exception for the customer name.** `error_msg` is Intuit's own text and may
quote one. It gets no longer window for possibly explaining a billing dispute
later — that is what the accounting records are for. The principle: do not
retain potentially identifying diagnostic text longer merely because it might
someday be useful.

**The earlier instruction on the legal-version tables is WITHDRAWN.** Both stay in
the sweep with reference-preserving executors. The distinction we had missed:
"not subject to unconditional age-based deletion" ≠ "must not be processed
by the sweep." A reference-aware sweep is the mechanism that gives bounded
retention while preserving evidentiary dependencies; an exemption would have made
these tables accumulate forever.

**And the method rule that cost a wasted review cycle:** do not classify retention
behaviour from the manifest or the table name — the executor is authoritative
evidence of what the sweep actually does. We reported a defect in
`sms_disclosure_versions` that its executor had always prevented, because we read a
table and a number instead of the query.

## 2026-08-19.1 — the windows are APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS

**What changed.** All 15 rules were reviewed: 8 approved as written, 4 windows
changed, 2 tables removed from the fixed sweep entirely.

| Rule | Was | Now | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `audit_logs` | 24m | **36m** | Two years creates an evidence discontinuity: the report survives, the acceptance survives, and the proof of who did what to them is gone |
| `report_versions` | 36m | **84m** | Hash-chained snapshots are part of the report's evidence chain. Seven years of PDF backed by three years of provenance is not a coherent horizon |
| `tenant_marketplace_import_history` | 36m | **12m** | Operational history. Three years needs a purpose this table does not have |
| `tenant_slug_history` | 36m | **12m** | The purpose is stopping a retired slug being reissued; that risk does not run three years. Disputes are legal hold's job |
| `sms_disclosure_versions` | 36m | **removed from sweep** | See below |
| `tenant_legal_versions` | 36m | **removed from sweep** | See below |

**The defect we reported, and the half of it that was not real.** We reported
that a consent record could outlive the text it names, and proposed that both tables
leave the sweep. The point was accepted and generalised into a rule. Then implementing
it meant reading the executors, and they did not say what the manifest said:

- `sms_disclosure_versions` **was already reference-preserving**. Its executor
  deletes only a version that is superseded AND cited by no `sms_consent_log` row,
  and it keeps the current version. Our report was wrong about this table. We had
  read the manifest — a table and a number — and not the executor, which is what
  the number actually does.
- `tenant_legal_versions` **was genuinely exposed**, and became so in this same
  session: its executor checks only that a newer version exists, which was correct
  until `account_acceptances` arrived — a ledger that is never swept and that
  stores the version and content hash of the text a person was shown.

So the rule stands and the framing was half wrong. Both tables stay IN the sweep
with reference-preserving executors, rather than being removed from it — the
rule is retain-while-referenced, not keep-forever, and it does not mean every
SMS disclosure version is stored permanently. Removing them from the sweep would
have let superseded rows accumulate indefinitely, which is not what was asked
for. The missing
`notExists(account_acceptances)` check is now in the tenant executor, so both tables
implement the same rule.

**Why this version is `approved_with_conditions` and not `approved`.** A decision
handed straight to an engineering team has to carry its own unmet conditions, so
the status names them rather than implying there are none. Three of the five
were unmet at this version — the dependency-aware sweep, the `legal_hold`
override (which had **zero occurrences in the codebase** when this version
shipped; see 2026-08-19.3 above), and the customer ToS re-accept change summary. A reader who sees
`approved` stops asking what is left.

**And a scope limit that belongs here rather than in a plan.** This covers
DATABASE retention only. Object storage, Durable Objects, KV and queues were never
in the compliance register. A green retention gate does not mean the
data lifecycle has been reviewed.

## 2026-08-18.1 — the acceptance ledger declared out of scope, and nothing deleted

**What changed.** `account_acceptances` is declared `RETENTION_OUT_OF_SCOPE`. The
table is new: one row per document a staff member accepted, written in the same
`db.batch()` as the `users` row it belongs to.

**Why out of scope rather than a window.** Expiring a row here does not shrink a
record — it destroys one, and it destroys it in a specific direction. The account
survives; the proof that its holder accepted anything does not. That is the state
`account = EXISTS, acceptance_ledger = ABSENT` that must never occur, and which
this table was created to make unreachable. A retention sweep
would reach it deliberately, on a timer, for every account old enough — the one
mechanism guaranteed to produce it.

**The clock this row already has.** Its natural lifetime is the ACCOUNT's, not the
calendar's: it should die when the `users` row it belongs to does. That happens on
the tenant purge and in the staff offboarding lifecycle, and both already destroy
it. Adding a second, shorter clock would not bound anything that is not already
bounded; it would only guarantee that some accounts outlive their own evidence.

**Volume.** Growth is bounded by accounts × published document versions, not by
usage — an account accepts each version once, and the unique index on
`(user, doc, version)` is what makes that true rather than conventional.

**Declared although nothing went red.** `LEDGER_NAME` in
`scripts/check-retention-manifest.mjs` matches no part of `account_acceptances`,
so this table could have shipped with `lint:retention` green. That is the same
silence that let `tenant_destruction_records` go a year without a decision, and
the reason the entry exists is that somebody read the table, not that a gate
asked.

**What did not change.** No period, no table in `RETENTION_MANIFEST`, no anchor
column, no `decideBy` date, and nothing new is deleted or erased anywhere. The
digest moved because the gate hashes the exclusion list too.

## 2026-08-17.3 — one table declared out of scope, and nothing deleted

**What changed.** `deployment_legal_versions` is declared `RETENTION_OUT_OF_SCOPE`.
The table is new in the same change: it holds the deployment's own legal documents
— the agent terms — which have no tenant, because an agent account is global and
its counterparty is whoever operates the deployment.

**Why out of scope rather than a window.** The row is the ONLY copy of the text an
acceptance points at. `users.terms_accepted` stores a version and a content hash,
not the body, so deleting a row here does not shrink a record — it makes an
existing one unverifiable, and the signer can no longer be shown what they agreed
to. The version+hash design is only defensible because the accepted version can be
reconstructed later, and a sweep over this table is the one thing that would make
that claim false.

The usual argument for a window does not apply either: the table grows with
PUBLICATIONS, not with usage — a handful of rows over the life of a deployment.

**What did not change.** No period, no table, no anchor column, no `decideBy` date,
and nothing new is deleted or erased anywhere. The digest moved because the gate
hashes the exclusion list too, which is the point: adding a table that production
will never sweep is a decision, and it should not be possible to make it silently.

**Not `tenant_legal_versions`' rule, deliberately.** That table's rule deletes a
version once a NEWER one exists for the same `(tenant, doc)`. Copying it here would
delete exactly the superseded bodies that older acceptances still name.

## 2026-08-17.2 — a rename, and nothing else

**What changed.** One word. The retention action formerly written `anonymize` is
now written `erase_in_place`, in this catalogue and in the erasure manifest that
shares the verb.

**What did not change.** No period. No table. No anchor column. No exclusion, no
open question, no `decideBy` date. Every row still expires exactly when it did
before this version, and the executor still performs exactly the same SQL. The
digest moved because the action string is one of the operative fields it hashes —
which is the gate working as designed: it cannot tell a rename from a
re-decision, so it refuses both until a human says which one this is. This one is
a rename.

**Why the old name had to go.** What the action does is overwrite identifier
columns with a sentinel in a row that
survives. That is not CCPA deidentification — which carries substantive
conditions we do not meet — and it is not GDPR anonymisation either. Calling it
`anonymize` invited a future reader, or a future legal document, to cite the
label as evidence that we had produced legally deidentified data. It is a
familiar failure mode: an internal classification read downstream as an
established fact. `erase_in_place` describes the operation and asserts nothing
about its legal effect.

**Also renamed in the same change**, for the same reason and recorded here
because it is the other half of one decision: the erasure manifest's data
category `user.biometric.signature` became `user.signature.rendered_image`, and
the rule carries `biometricStatus: 'not_assessed_as_biometric'`. Not
`biometric: false` — a boolean answer is itself a legal conclusion, which is the
mistake being fixed. That category is not an operative field of this policy and
does not affect the digest.

## 2026-08-17.1 — report PDFs get a window

**What changed.** `report_pdfs` gained a retention rule. It had none: the
tenant purge destroys these objects when a workspace is destroyed, but nothing
expired one while the tenant lived, so a rendered PDF of a property — the
address, the photographs, the defects found there — was kept for as long as the
company existed with no decision behind it.

**The period.** Seven years by default, and each tenant may set their own in
Settings → Compliance. Zero means indefinite.

**Why seven, and what seven is NOT.** This is a **platform-selected default for
the tenant-silent case**. It is not a statutory retention period, and not a
representation that seven years is the maximum legally required period.

That distinction is the whole reason this entry exists. An earlier derivation in
this repository read seven as "five plus two" — five years from Illinois for
home-inspection contracts, reports and supporting data, plus two years past
final disposition of a qualifying judicial proceeding. That derivation does not
hold: the Illinois period is stated as five years **or** two years
past final disposition, **whichever is longer**, so the second figure is an
event-dependent tail rather than a fixed cap. A proceeding ending in year six
extends the statutory period past seven. Seven years therefore cannot be
presented as "the longest statutory period", and a register row reading
`P7Y — legal basis = Illinois law` would invite the next reader to conclude that
a California tenant is legally required to keep seven years.

The default is informed **primarily by defence of legal claims** and
**secondarily by regulatory record retention**. The jurisdiction facts behind it,
each with the date it was checked, are in
`server/lib/compliance/report-pdf-retention.ts` — including that Washington
completed a home-inspector rules revision in July 2026, which is why every fact
carries an as-of date rather than a bare citation.

**Tenant override is not absolute.** The effective period is
`jurisdictional minimum + tenant instruction + platform constraints`, never
`tenant choice > law`. Indefinite retention is a tenant OPTION, not a tenant
entitlement, and seven years is a default rather than a ceiling. The resolver in
code answers only the middle term — what the tenant asked for, or the default
when they have not asked. A jurisdictional floor, once one can be determined per
tenant, is applied above it and deliberately not folded in: one function
silently responsible for a legal determination it has no facts for is how a
wrong answer gets an authoritative shape.

**Why the disclosure sits next to the control.** The dominant competitor stores
reports indefinitely, including after cancellation. A customer who never opens a
disclosure would reasonably assume our number is required of them, so the
disclosure wording renders plainly beside the field rather than behind a control
or on a policy page.

**Mechanically.** This is the first rule that reaches outside D1. The row points
at an R2 object, so the executor deletes the object first and the row second,
and **refuses to run at all without a bucket** rather than deleting rows that
point at objects nothing else could ever reach — the row is the only thing that
knows the key.

---

## 2026-08-15.1 — the catalogue's first versioned state

The state the versioning began from: fourteen rules, seven declared
out-of-scope with reasons, and two parked as open questions with dates by which
they must be answered. See `retention-manifest.ts` for each, and
`retention-windows.ts` for the reasoning behind every period.
