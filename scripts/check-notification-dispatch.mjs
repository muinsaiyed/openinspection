/**
 * Notification dispatch gate (`lint:notification-dispatch`).
 *
 * `lint:provider-helpers` guards the TRANSPORT — that email goes through an
 * EmailProvider and SMS through a MessagingProvider. Transport was never the
 * problem. Everything above it was:
 *
 *   - a route that builds its own HTML sends real mail that is not branded,
 *     not editable, not translatable, and — the part that matters here —
 *     arrives at the boundary with no name, so no preference can ever apply
 *     to it;
 *   - a second copy of the SMS gate chain does not BYPASS the gates, it just
 *     has whichever ones someone remembered to copy. That is not a theory:
 *     the STOP-revocation check landed in one of three copies, and the other
 *     two went on texting numbers that had opted out.
 *
 * Both were found by hand-auditing call sites, twice, and the second audit
 * found what the first structurally could not (it swept routes; the miss was
 * inside a service). A third audit would miss the next one. So the rules are
 * here instead.
 *
 * Every rule is HARD — there is no baseline. Each one is currently at zero,
 * and the point is to keep it there: a baseline would let the next one in and
 * call it pre-existing.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-notification-dispatch.mjs
 *
 * console.* is intentional — build script, not server code.
