/**
 * Who sent an SMS, and on whose behalf. Two questions, two answers.
 *
 * The owner of the number is not automatically the legal
 * sender. In the default mode a message leaves the PLATFORM's shared number
 * carrying the TENANT's brand — so "who initiated this transmission" and "on
 * whose behalf was it sent" are genuinely different, and neither should have to
 * be reconstructed later by inferring it from `sms_mode`. A record that has to
 * be inferred is a record that will be inferred wrongly.
 *
 * ── Why the platform is always the sender, even on a BYO key ─────────────────
 * The tempting simplification is that in `own` mode the tenant is the sender.
 * They are not. We chose the provider, we wrote the template, we operate the
 * consent gate, and we decide what may go out; a bring-your-own key changes
 * whose account is billed, not who built the path. Collapsing the two roles is
 * the exact move to avoid — and the spec asserts against it in both
 * BYO-shaped modes rather than trusting the comment.
 *
 * ── Why the name is not `resolveSenderIdentity` ──────────────────────────────
 * `server/lib/email/sender-identity.ts` already exports that name, with a
 * different signature and a different return type, and it is imported by
 * `server/services/email/base.ts` and named in a schema column comment. Two
 * exports of one name in sibling domain folders are distinguishable only by
 * their import path — the one thing a reader does not see at the call site in a
 * diff. So this side carries the `Sms` prefix on the function and the type. The
 * FILE keeps the plain name: the directory already says which domain it is, and
 * `sms/sms-sender-identity.ts` stutters.
 *
 * The email side is deliberately untouched. It is shipped, it has its own spec,
 * and renaming a live export to make room for a new one bills the cost to the
 * wrong side of the change.
