/**
 * Retry safety for `POST /api/ai/reviews` (#61).
 *
 * The route is contained by its OWN dedup, not by the mounted guard: a unique
 * index on (tenant, artifact type, artifact id, ai call, reviewer) plus
 * `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. That is asserted here rather than declared in a
 * baseline entry, because "naturally idempotent" is a claim about behaviour and
 * this file is the only thing that can check it.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY `ON CONFLICT` AND NOT READ-THEN-INSERT. Two concurrent retries would
 * both see no row and both insert; the unique index would then reject the second
 * with a 500 — turning a harmless replay into an error the client has to
 * interpret. The conflict clause makes the second write a no-op atomically.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CONTROLS BELOW ARE NOT OPTIONAL. "One row after two calls" is satisfied
 * for free by an implementation that never inserts anything, so every dedup case
 * is paired with a case that MUST produce a second row. A second REVIEWER is two
 * facts, not a duplicate — that is what a four-eyes policy would want, and a key
 * that collapsed them would destroy the evidence.
