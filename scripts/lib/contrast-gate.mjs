/**
 * The measuring half of `scripts/check-contrast.mjs`.
 *
 * Split out for the file-size gate, along a seam that was already there: this
 * file decides what FAILS, `contrast-report.mjs` decides how that is printed,
 * and `check-contrast.mjs` is the CLI that walks the tree and wires the two.
 * Nothing here writes to the console, so every function is callable from a spec
 * with a synthetic stylesheet and synthetic files.
 *
 * The reasoning about WHAT is and is not covered lives in the CLI's header, next
 * to the gate's name, because that is where a reader looks first.
