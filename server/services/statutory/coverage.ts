/**
 * What this inspection still owes its statutory form, WHILE it can still be
 * answered.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Until now the only thing that could answer "is this form producible" was
 * producing it, and that path requires a PUBLISHED report -- so the first time
 * an inspector learned a required box was empty, the report had already gone to
 * the client. Verified in production on 2026-09-05: a TREC inspection was
 * created, worked and published, and the download then refused with
 * "2 required field(s) have no answer: inspector_name, inspector_license_number"
 * -- two facts that had been missing since before the inspection existed.
 *
 * This asks the same question against the same rule, with no published report
 * and nothing recorded, so the answer can be shown in the editor.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE RULE IS BORROWED, NEVER RESTATED. `missingRequiredFields` is the
 * function the refusal itself calls. A coverage indicator that decided
 * "still missing" its own way would agree on the day it was written and drift
 * afterwards -- and a checklist that reads complete over a form that will be
 * refused is worse than no checklist, because it is believed.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────
 * It does not judge the revision, the withdrawal, or whether the deployment
 * holds the authority's bytes. Those are answered by `revisionStatusForInspection`
 * and the produce path, they are not per-field, and duplicating them here would
 * create a second opinion about the one thing this subsystem exists to keep
 * single.
