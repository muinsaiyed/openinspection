/**
 * Timezone-safety gate for the calendar surface.
 *
 * A civil calendar day mixed with UTC conversion shifts a day in UTC-positive
 * zones — the calendar off-by-one bug. The correct path is server-side tz
 * bucketing (calendar-items.service emits civilDate/startTime via server/lib/tz)
 * and string-keyed cells (civilDateOf), never Date/UTC math in the views.
 *
 * SCOPED to the calendar surface on purpose: every real bug lives here, while
 * legitimate `.toISOString().slice(0,10)` uses (server UTC-today, report year,
 * QBO document-creation dates) live elsewhere. QBO *money-movement* TxnDate is
 * NOT on that list any more — neither the payment nor the credit memo: both
 * book an accounting period, so both derive from the ledger row's occurred_at
 * in the tenant zone via epochMsToWallClockYmd (see txnDateFor in
 * server/services/qbo/invoice-sync.ts, which is the one date path they share).
 * A line opts out with a trailing — or immediately preceding —
 * `// tz-lint-ok: <reason>` comment.
 *
 * Flags:
 *   P1  hardcoded-Z instant composed from a civil date + wall-clock time
 *       (`${date}T09:00:00.000Z`) — anchor with wallClockToEpochMs(…, tz) instead.
 *   P2  `.toISOString().slice(0, 10)` — UTC-day bucketing; bucket by civilDate.
 *   P3  `new Date(<single arg>).get(Hours|Minutes|Date|Day)` — reads local parts
 *       off a parsed instant. (Multi-arg `new Date(y, m, d)` geometry is exempt.)
