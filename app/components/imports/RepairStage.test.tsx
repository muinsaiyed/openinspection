/**
 * The entries somebody fixes over two sittings.
 *
 * One field at a time, because the server reports the FIRST thing wrong with an
 * entry reading down it — an edit box per reported field is what makes this a
 * fill-in-the-blank rather than a JSON syntax exercise.
 *
 * What is SENT is the whole entry with that one field replaced: the repair
 * endpoint rewrites the payload wholesale, so a patch alone would erase every
 * other field. Both halves of that are asserted, because the shape of the
 * request is invisible on screen and a component that sent only the edited field
 * would look identical.
 *
 * Paging is asserted by what RENDERS, not by whether the component re-rendered:
 * a page control wired to nothing looks exactly like a working one.
