/**
 * What this product OFFERS: whether a given AI capability may run at all on a
 * given set of credentials.
 *
 * This is a different question from the two that already had answers.
 * `resolve-provider.ts` decides WHICH key a call would run on; `metering.ts`
 * counts what a call consumed. Neither one ever asks whether the capability is
 * something the product currently ships on that key — so nothing did, and the
 * answer was whatever the runtime happened to make possible.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS EVEN THOUGH IT CHANGES NO BEHAVIOR TODAY.
 * The managed path is dark right now for one reason: no deployment has
 * provisioned a platform key. That is an operational fact, not a product
 * decision, and it reverses the instant someone runs a single
 * `wrangler secret put` — an action taken by whoever is provisioning
 * infrastructure, who is not choosing what the product ships. A posture that
 * holds only while a secret is missing is not a posture; it is an accident that
 * has not been corrected yet. Written down here, the same answer survives the
 * key being configured, and turning a capability on becomes an edit to this
 * table that shows up in a diff.
 *
 * WHY IT IS COMPILED IN AND NOT AN ENVIRONMENT SWITCH.
 * What the product offers is a release decision. An env flag would let one
 * deployment quietly ship a capability that was never released anywhere else,
 * and the source would no longer describe the product. Flipping any line below
 * is a code change, reviewed like one.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASKS ABOUT, AND WHY THAT CHANGED.
 * This gate used to key on `AiUsageKind` — the two-member COST split
 * ('translate' | 'assist'). That could not express the posture, because
 * `assist` alone spans several different kinds of writing: rewording one
 * finding, summarising a whole report, and offering upkeep advice are not the
 * same statement about a property, and a single answer attached to `assist`
 * gave all three the same treatment. The posture now lives in
 * `output-classification.ts`, keyed on what the output IS, and this function
 * reads it. Metering still uses `AiUsageKind`; the two vocabularies answer
 * different questions and are deliberately not merged.
 *
 * WHAT REMAINS HERE: the credential facts, which no classification can decide —
 * whether the tenant's own key has been confirmed. See below.
 *
 * WHY AN UNCONFIRMED TENANT KEY IS REFUSED HERE AND NOT ONLY AT SAVE TIME.
 * The save path (`POST /api/admin/secrets`) will not store a new tenant key
 * without the workspace confirming what its provider account permits. That gate
 * covers keys stored from now on and nothing else: a key stored before it
 * existed has been confirmed against nothing, yet would keep calling the
 * provider forever. Two gates for one rule is not duplication — the save gate
 * decides what may be WRITTEN, this one decides what may RUN, and only the
 * second one is true of keys that were already there.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous, like `resolveAi`: no I/O, the whole policy fits on one
 * screen, and it is testable without a database. That is why the confirmation
 * arrives as an argument — it is per-tenant state, resolved once per request
 * beside the credential itself, never looked up here.
