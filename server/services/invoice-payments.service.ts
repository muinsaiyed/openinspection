/**
 * The payment-ledger face of an invoice.
 *
 * The boundary against `invoice.service.ts` is checkable rather than a matter
 * of taste: `InvoiceService` owns the invoice ROW — create, read, mark sent,
 * void, delete, earnings — and this module owns the LEDGER, meaning every path
 * that reads or appends `order_payments`, whether directly or through
 * `payment-ledger.service`. The check is mechanical: `payment-ledger.service`
 * has exactly one value importer among the two, and it is this file. A new
 * money writer that finds itself importing it in the other one is in the
 * wrong place.
 *
 * These are free functions taking the drizzle handle, the same shape as
 * `payment-ledger.service.ts` which they all orchestrate; `InvoiceService`
 * keeps a one-line method for each so no caller has to change. Parameter
 * ORDER is preserved exactly as each method declared it — `(id, tenantId)` for
 * some and `(tenantId, id)` for others — because both are `string` and
 * "tidying" that up during a move is how the two get swapped in silence.

 * on the day the typo was spotted, so the correction belongs to the period
 * the mistake landed in, not to the day of data entry.
