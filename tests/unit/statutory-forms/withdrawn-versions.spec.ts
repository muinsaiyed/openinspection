/**
 * A withdrawn revision is not selected, the one beside it still is, and the
 * catalogue can still say WHY it was withdrawn.
 *
 * Withdrawal is the only lever this subsystem has for the one fault it cannot
 * take back: a field map that was wrong, applied to an authority's own form,
 * producing an official document that is already in somebody else's hands.
 * Stopping NEW production is all that is left to do, and it has to happen
 * without the revision leaving the catalogue — re-issuing a report produced from
 * it still has to resolve.
 *
 * ── AND THE REASON IS HALF THE FACT ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * The second half of this file is about `withdrawnVersionsFor`, which exists
 * because "no revision covers that date" and "the revision that covers that
 * date was withdrawn" leave `versionForInspection` by the same `null` exit.
 * They are not the same sentence to read: one means this deployment publishes
 * nothing for that day, the other means it published something and took it out
 * of service — and whether the reader waits for us or goes and gets another
 * form depends on which of the two reasons it was.
