  // false the day it was written: `seed-marketplace-libraries.ts` upserts the
  // catalogue from this repository's own fixtures, and its caller
  // (`server/api/admin/admin-content-install.ts`) is gated on role, not on
  // deployment mode. So a self-hosted deployment had a populated catalogue and
  // a locked door in front of it, and could install nothing at all.
  //
  // The line that IS mode-specific runs elsewhere: publishing a catalogue row
  // across workspaces lives under `server/portal/`, which mounts only when
  // `hasPortalIntegrationApi` holds. That is a fact about the topology and not
  // a gate — a self-hosted deployment has no platform on the other end. Nothing
  // here publishes; an operator installs what their own build already ships.

  // modes, which is why this page is all that had to change.

  // comment packs and three statutory forms on screen and the count at 17.
  //
  // It goes through the URL rather than component state so the loader re-runs
