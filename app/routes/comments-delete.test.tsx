/**
 * OI #291 — `/library/comments` could create, edit and touch a canned comment
 * but never delete one, so 2,774 rows had no delete path at any surface. The
 * `DELETE /api/admin/comments/{id}` route already existed with zero callers.
 *
 * These tests pin the two things that make a destructive control safe: it never
 * fires without confirmation, and the confirmation says WHICH row (or how many)
 * — a library page is dozens of near-identical entries, and "delete this
 * comment?" cannot tell you whether the right one is selected.
