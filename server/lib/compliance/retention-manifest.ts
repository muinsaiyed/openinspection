/**
 * OI #276 — the log-table retention manifest.
 *
 * The companion catalogue to `erasure-manifest.ts`, and a DIFFERENT question
 * from it. Erasure answers "a named person asked us to forget them, what
 * happens?"; this answers "nobody asked, and the data is still here — what
 * expires it?" (GDPR Art. 5(1)(e) storage limitation). A table can be entirely
 * correct under the first and indefensible under the second, which is why the
 * two lists are separate and why a table has to appear in one of these three
 * arrays or the gate (`scripts/check-retention-manifest.mjs`) fails.
 *
 * ── The numbers live next door ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `retention-windows.ts` holds every period and the reason for it, one constant
 * per clock, and this file re-exports them so no import site cares which of the
 * two it came from. That file is where you go to change HOW LONG; this one is
 * WHICH TABLES and WHAT ACTION. `retention-rule-types.ts` holds the SHAPES —
 * what a rule, an exclusion and an open question may say — and is re-exported
 * here for the same reason.
 *
 * ⚠️ The three ARRAYS stay in this file whatever else moves out of it. Both
 * gates open this path and parse them out of the source text, so relocating one
 * does not fail loudly: the manifest gate exits on "could not locate" and the
 * policy gate hashes an empty parse.
 *
 * ── Erase-in-place means the actor does not survive ─────────────────────────
 * `erase_in_place` on this list is the same verb the erasure orchestrator uses,
 * and it has to keep meaning the same thing: the structured event survives, the
 * identifiers do not — including free text. A rule that scrubbed identifier
 * columns and left prose behind would claim a legal outcome it does not
 * deliver. The column sets come from the shared satellite-PII module for
 * exactly that reason (see `retention-logs.ts`).
 *
 * The verb is deliberately NOT called `anonymize`, here or in the erasure
 * manifest. The old name was retired because writing a
 * sentinel over identifier columns in a surviving row is not CCPA
 * deidentification and not GDPR anonymisation, and the name invited a future
 * reader to cite it as proof that it was.
 *
 * ── Scope: platform-operational logs ────────────────────────────────────────
 * This catalogue governs the platform's own operational record surface. A
 * business record (a report, a message to a counterparty, a notice a contact
 * reads) is product data whose lifetime is the erasure manifest's question and
 * the inspection record window's, not an operational log window's. The gate's
 * header states where that line is drawn and which tables sit on the far side
 * of it.

That is the operator\'s own template content and no adapter carrying contacts emits warnings at all, which is why the action stays `erase_in_place` rather than becoming a full delete. ⚠️ But a low assessed exposure is not a substitute for an accurate description: this sentence exists because the list above it used to end at the authorisations and say the row carried no third-party data. Two lifetimes share this rule because a table gets one: a run the operator staged and walked away from expires after thirty days, and a run waiting on a person to convert its file expires after ninety. The window declared here is the longer of the two, and it is enforced as a bound on the DATA rather than only on the column: apply opens a fresh undo window but may not push a run past ninety days from its own creation (`appliedExpiry`), because apply does not rewrite the uploaded file it is re-dating. The per-row due date lives on the column named above and is what the sweep compares. A batch with no due date written is left alone rather than swept at the outer bound — see rowWindowColumn.

Giving it an independent window would give one lifetime two clocks, and the two would drift the first time either moved — the same argument as migration_intake_entries above. Its clock is therefore the clock of the report, and what actually removes it is stated rather than implied: a subject erasure deletes the row outright (ERASURE_MANIFEST, report_translations.content), deleting the inspection deletes it with the reports it belongs to (deleteInspectionCascade), and a tenant destruction removes it with the database it lives in. ⚠️ That middle path is written down because for a time it did not exist: the cascade derives its child set from tables carrying `inspection_id`, this table is keyed by `report_id`, so the reports were deleted and the translated copy of their text stayed behind under an id nothing resolved. An exclusion whose whole ground is "it dies with its report" is worth nothing while the code lets it outlive the report, and being a derived AI-produced copy does not by itself earn this table a calendar window — what it earns is the requirement that every path removing a report removes the translation too. This entry is therefore only as true as that hop, which is why a test asserts it rather than a comment claiming it. ⚠️ Nothing expires a `reports` row on a calendar, so this is NOT a claim that translations age out — it is a claim that they die when the document does, which is the honest description of the current design and is why no window is declared here. Declared although the gate never asked: LEDGER_NAME matches no part of `report_translations`, so this table could have shipped with lint:retention green — the same silence that let tenant_destruction_records go a year without a decision.',
