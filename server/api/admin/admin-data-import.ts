// Admin → data import & one-time migration sub-router.
//
// Three routes, one subject: what can happen to an import run somebody sent us
// to convert. Delivery of the converted bundle (POST /import), acknowledging
// that a person has picked the file up (POST /import/acknowledge), and handing
// it back unconverted (POST /import/decline).
//
// The one-time legacy finding-key migration moved to `admin-finding-keys.ts`
// when this file crossed the size gate — it shared nothing with these but a
// prefix. Route definitions are co-located with their `.openapi()` handlers.
// Mounted at `/` by the admin aggregator.
