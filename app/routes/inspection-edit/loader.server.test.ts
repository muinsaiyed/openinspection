/**
 * The editor loader's section overlay.
 *
 * -- WHAT WENT WRONG --------------------------------------------------------
 * The loader replaces the template snapshot's `sections` WHOLESALE with
 * report-data's projection, and that projection deliberately carries no
 * `attributes` (a declared skip in `scripts/check-item-key-parity.mjs`: the
 * report does not need them). `ItemEditor` renders `ItemAttributesPanel` only
 * when `item.attributes` is a non-empty array, so the panel — built, wired to
 * `onItemAttribute`, and correct — never once received data.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-30 across the seed templates: 47 statutory bindings resolve
 * from `item_attribute` (TREC 23, FL Citizens roof 24) and not one of them was
 * answerable; `residential.json` carries 21 more attribute definitions that no
 * inspector could reach either. TREC is published and in use.
 *
 * The fix merges the snapshot's attributes back onto the projected items. It
 * does NOT change the projection.
