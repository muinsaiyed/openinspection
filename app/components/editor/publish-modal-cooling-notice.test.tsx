/**
 * Portal #98 §3.4, said at the moment it changes an expectation.
 *
 * The account-wide banner answers "does this company have a window"; it does
 * not answer "is the thing I am about to press going to land in it". An
 * inspector presses Publish believing the client now has their report, and
 * inside the window that belief is wrong by up to a day — so the correction
 * belongs on this button, not only on the page behind it.
 *
 * The two failure modes worth holding down are opposite: saying NOTHING inside
 * the window (the inspector tells the client to check their inbox), and saying
 * something to a company that is not in one (a permanent scary notice on the
 * most-used button in the product).
