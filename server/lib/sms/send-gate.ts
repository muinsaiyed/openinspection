 *   requiring it would mean no test send could ever succeed.
 *
 *   `test` is NOT exempt from revocation. Honoring STOP does not depend on the

 *   is a test — a tenant testing against a number that texted STOP should be
 *   told so, not quietly sent to.

 * The one gate chain every outbound SMS passes through.

 * There used to be three copies: the real send path (`sendOneSms`), the
 * template test send, and the settings "test connection" send. They did not
 * BYPASS the gates — that would be the obvious bug and it is not the one that
 * was present. They each carried their own copy of the chain, and a copy only
 * has the gates someone remembered to add to it.
 *
 * That is not theoretical. When the STOP-revocation check was added, it landed
 * in exactly one of the three. Nobody skipped a step; the other two simply were
 * not there to receive it. A copied chain does this every time, and it would
 * have done it again for the next gate.
 *
 * So the chain lives here once, and a caller declares its `purpose` instead of
 * declaring nothing and being exempt from whatever was not copied. The
 * exemptions are stated below, in one place, where they can be argued with.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS WITH THE CALLER: writing `automation_logs` rows, resolving the
 * body template, and the provider call itself. This function decides whether
