## What it is

OpenInspection is [open source home inspection software](https://inspectorhub.io/open-source) — a complete inspection stack: inspector dashboard, public booking widget, a field-ready inspection editor, professional HTML reports with e-signatures, AI assistance, and PWA offline support, all running on Cloudflare's edge and self-hosted on a single Worker.

### Architecture

- **Single Cloudflare Worker** (`workers/app.ts`) — a Hono entry that mounts the full API in-process and delegates page routes to React Router v8 SSR (the cloudflare/react-router-hono-fullstack-template shape)
- **API** (`server/`) — Hono + Drizzle + D1, handles all business logic
- **Web** (`app/`) — React Router v8 + React 19 + Tailwind v4, SSR on CF Workers
- **Shared UI** (`packages/shared-ui/`) — Design System 0523 token-based components
- One deployable; React Router loaders/actions call the API directly through an in-process `API_WORKER` self-binding (no network hop, no second worker)

### Inspector workflow
- 3-pane editor; a new workspace starts with 250+ canned comments, 80 repair items, 4 rating systems and 7 inspection templates (residential, pre-listing, new construction ×2, sewer scope, radon, mold)
- Keyboard-driven: `1`-`5` ratings, `/` canned-comment library, `;` snippets, `?` cheatsheet, `⌘K` palette in the workspace
- Simultaneous editing — inspection results are a Yjs CRDT in a Durable Object
- Installable PWA; field data is offline-capable (the results document buffers in IndexedDB and merges on reconnect). Photo and video *binary* upload needs a connection and says so rather than queueing
- Migrate from Spectora through the import wizard, which shows what the conversion produced before anything is written

### Customer experience
- Company-level public booking widget (`/book/<slug>`) with auto-assignment, optional inspector choice, and Turnstile bot protection
- E-sign agreements with Ed25519 audit chain — server-rendered signed PDF + Certificate of Completion via Browser Run, evidence-pack zip with email delivery, public verifier URL (`/v/<token>`) with QR code on PDFs + offline self-verify (`/verify`) for court-friendly independence from the server, optional inspector pre-sign
- Branded report viewer with print-as-PDF

### Agent / referral
- Agent CRM with referral tracking
- "Share with buyer" link generation
- Recommendations export

### Self-host friendly
- Runs **standalone** (single-tenant) by default — one fixed tenant holds all your data, no subdomains to manage
- Branded UI (logo, colors) configurable in Settings
- Tenant-scoped D1 data isolation baked into every table

## Why OpenInspection

- **Cheap to run**: a solo inspector's whole year fits in Cloudflare's smallest paid Workers plan, plus a domain (~$10/yr). The free plan is enough to try it and enough to deploy it, but ⚠️ **not enough to run it**: its CPU ceiling is in the low milliseconds and this application's p95 request is ~49ms (measured over seven days of live traffic, 2026-09-05). A statutory-form render alone is ~470ms.
- **Yours**: fork it, change templates, add integrations. No vendor lock-in.
- **Fast**: edge-deployed, < 100 ms response times globally
- **Compliant**: PBKDF2-SHA256 password hashing, hash-chained Ed25519 audit log on e-signatures (ESIGN Act + UETA), server-rendered PDF + Certificate of Completion via Browser Run, offline-verifiable evidence pack, tenant-scoped data isolation
- **Modern**: React Router v8 + React 19 + Hono API + Drizzle + Tailwind v4 — small surface, easy to read

## Quick start

There are three ways to run OpenInspection, from zero effort to full control. Pick one.

### 1. Try the hosted service (no deployment)

Want to evaluate the product without running any infrastructure? Register at [**inspectorhub.io/register**](https://inspectorhub.io/register) with your email, click the activation link, and a workspace is created for you — the app lives at `app.inspectorhub.io`. This is the managed edition of this exact codebase (first 5 inspections free, no card), pre-loaded with starter templates so you can click through a real inspection immediately. You can export your data and switch to a self-hosted deploy at any time.

### 2. Deploy to Cloudflare (one-click)

1. Click the **Deploy to Cloudflare** button above and follow the wizard. The DEPLOY was verified end-to-end on the Cloudflare Workers **Free** plan (2026-05-31), and the wizard's "Workers Paid" notice banner is **non-blocking** — the deploy completes. ⚠️ That verified the install, not the running application: under real traffic the free plan's CPU ceiling returns HTTP 1102 on ordinary pages (observed 2026-09-05). Plan for a paid Workers plan before putting it in front of clients.
2. Cloudflare reads the committed `wrangler.jsonc` (which carries **placeholder IDs only**) and **auto-provisions and binds** the required resources — D1 (`DB`), KV (`TENANT_CACHE`), R2 (`PHOTOS`), the `BROWSER` binding, the Durable Objects and the Workflow — injecting the real resource IDs for you. There is no manual ID editing.
3. After the deploy finishes, visit `/setup` on your new Worker URL and enter your **`SETUP_CODE`** to create the first admin account. For the one-click path, the wizard reads [`.dev.vars.example`](.dev.vars.example) and surfaces `SETUP_CODE` as a secret field you fill in **during** the deploy — that is the value you type at `/setup`. It must be any value of at least 6 characters. `/setup` is gated solely on this secret: if `SETUP_CODE` is unset the endpoint refuses to proceed, so an unprovisioned Worker can't be claimed. You can change it later in the dashboard under **Settings → Variables and Secrets**.

### 3. Deploy with the CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InspectorHub/OpenInspection
cd OpenInspection
npm install
npm run setup:cloudflare    # provisions D1/KV/R2 + writes real IDs to a gitignored wrangler.local.jsonc
npm run deploy              # full react-router build, then wrangler deploy
```

- `npm run setup:cloudflare` (`scripts/setup-cloudflare.js`) provisions the Cloudflare resources and writes their real IDs into a gitignored `wrangler.local.jsonc` (bootstrapped from the committed placeholder `wrangler.jsonc`).
- Use `npm run deploy`, **not** raw `wrangler deploy` — the npm script runs the full `react-router build` (bundling `server/` API + `app/` SSR into one worker) before deploying. Its tail then runs idempotent ensure-steps that provision the JWT keypair and **print the `SETUP_CODE` in the deploy output** if one is not already set (it never overwrites an existing value). Visit `/setup` with that code for your first login.
- For local development, use `npm run dev:hmr` (Vite dev server with hot module replacement, port 5173) for the fast iteration loop, or `npm run dev` (build-based — `react-router build` then `wrangler dev` on port 8787) to run the real bundled worker.
