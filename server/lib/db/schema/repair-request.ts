  // untagged item stays a valid item forever. Authored by the buyer or their

  // professional scope recommendation inside a document the buyer negotiates

  // ⚠️ TWO NEIGHBOURING ENUMS LOOK LIKE THIS ONE AND MUST NOT BE MERGED INTO IT:
  //  (a) `cost_items.action` (`schema/inspection/cost-items.ts`) keeps its own
  //      ['repair','replace','further_study']. That is the ASSESSOR classifying
  //      a commercial finding, where `further_study` is a real professional
  //      outcome; this is the buyer stating what they want, where it is not.
  //  (b) our severity vocabulary ['good','marginal','significant','minor'] is a
  //      CONDITION axis. This is the product's first ACTION axis. A condition
  //      and a requested remedy are different statements about a defect, so the
  //      two do not line up and neither can be derived from the other.
  //
  // ⚠️ THE FOUR VALUES ARE A PRODUCT CHOICE, NOT AN INDUSTRY DERIVATION, AND
  // THE ONE VENDOR WITH A PUBLISHED ANSWER PUTS THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE.
  // The plan that introduced this column cited "the union of HIP and ISN" for
  // the vocabulary. Checking that afterwards: ISN's help centre describes the
  // same four as something the reviewing AGENT selects — verbatim, "as a
  // response to the request item" — and Home Inspector Pro's page carries no
  // role label at all, so it settles nothing. Nobody was found putting these
  // four on the requester.
  //
  // The column stays on the REQUEST axis anyway, deliberately: "I want it
  // repaired / replaced / funded" is a coherent and useful thing for a buyer
  // to say, and HIP revealing a money field only under `fund` supports hanging
  // the amount off it. Both facts are recorded here because one of them is
  // evidence and the other is a decision, and a later reader must not mistake
  // the second for the first.
  //
  // ⚠️ A RESPONSE AXIS, IF IT IS EVER BUILT, MUST NOT REUSE THIS COLUMN OR ITS
  // VOCABULARY. Same four words on the same row for two different actors is
  // unreadable a year later — nothing would say whether `fund` was asked for
  // or offered. Name the roles in the columns (`requested_action` vs
  // `responded_action`) and give the response its own enum, even if the
  // members happen to coincide.
