# Testing — apps/openinspection

The single Worker serves both the typed JSON API and the React Router v8 UI, so
tests cover both surfaces. There are six suites — web unit, api/service unit,
worker-runtime, contract, end-to-end and type-level — each pinned to a
**location**: a spec's directory alone decides which config runs it. This document is the
canonical reference for the three things you need to get right: **where a spec
lives**, **how to write it**, and **how the run is initialized**.

The layout is enforced — `npm run lint:tests` (`scripts/check-test-layout.mjs`)
fails the build on a misplaced spec, and it runs in `npm run lint` (pre-push and
CI's `verify` job; it is not in the pre-commit rung).

Collection is enforced in **both** directions, by two gates rather than one:

- `npm run lint:tests` proves every literal `testMatch` in `playwright.config.ts`
  resolves to a file that exists — a project may not point at nothing.
- `npm run lint:e2e-coverage` (`scripts/check-e2e-spec-coverage.mjs`) proves the
  reverse: every spec in `tests/e2e/` is collected by some config. A spec nobody
  collects never runs, and a spec that never runs looks exactly like a spec that
  passes. It asks Playwright (`--list`) instead of re-reading `testMatch`, so it
  agrees with the runner by construction, and it discounts **sweep** configs —
  a config with no `projects` collects any file dropped into `testDir`, so it
  cannot testify that a particular spec was ever wired up. It prints the configs
  it consulted, both counts, and the name of every orphan, on every run.

## 1. Directory classification (`directory = suite`)

| Location | Suite | Command | Config | Runtime |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `app/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` (co-located) | web unit | `test:web` | `vitest.config.ts` | happy-dom |
| `tests/unit/<domain>/**/*.spec.ts` | api/service unit | `test:unit` | `vitest.api.config.ts` | node (+ better-sqlite3) |
| `tests/workers/**/*.spec.ts` | worker-runtime | `test:workers` | `vitest.workers.config.ts` | real `workerd` |
| `tests/contract/<party>/*.contract.spec.ts` | contract (offline) | `test:contract` | `vitest.contract.config.ts` | node, no network |
| `tests/contract/<party>/*.live.spec.ts` | contract (live) | `test:contract:live` | `vitest.contract.live.config.ts` | node + the real third-party API |
| `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts` | end-to-end | `test:e2e` · `test:e2e:seeded` | `playwright.config.ts` (seeds real D1) · `playwright.seeded.config.ts` | built worker + browser |
| `tests/**/*.spec-d.ts` | type-level | `test:types` | `vitest.typecheck.config.ts` | tsc typecheck |

### Choosing a home for a new spec

1. **Frontend component / loader / hook test?** → **co-locate** it beside the
   thing it tests as `Foo.test.tsx` (or `__tests__/Foo.test.tsx`) under `app/`.
   Never put a web test in `tests/`. The retired `tests/web/` tree does not come
   back.
2. **Server-side, no browser.** Does it depend on real Cloudflare runtime
   semantics — Queue delivery, Durable Objects, `workerd`-only APIs?
   - **Yes** → `tests/workers/` (real `workerd` via
     `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`; miniflare bindings are declared inline in
     the config, no wrangler file needed).
   - **No** → `tests/unit/<domain>/` (node env, stubs + `better-sqlite3`).
3. **Asserting on a THIRD PARTY's contract rather than our behaviour?** →
   `tests/contract/<party>/`. The distinguishing question is what a red run
   means: if the fix is usually "change our code to match theirs" rather than
   "fix our bug", it is a contract spec. See §2 for the two halves.
4. **Full-stack / browser / anything that hits a running worker** →
   `tests/e2e/`. One flat directory; `globalSetup` seeds real D1 so every E2E
   exercises the actual database.

More than one Playwright config reads that directory, and a spec belongs to
exactly one of them. `npm run lint:e2e-coverage` prints the full list on every
run — which config collects a spec, which one OWNS it, and which npm script (if
any) runs it — so read its output rather than a list copied into this page.

### The rules the gate enforces

- **No flat specs.** `tests/*.spec.ts`, `tests/web/*.spec.ts`, and
  `tests/unit/*.spec.ts` are rejected — a unit spec must live in a **domain
  directory** named after the `server/api/` module or service family it
  exercises (`tests/unit/auth/`, `tests/unit/inspections/`, …).
- **These directories must not exist:** `tests/web/unit`, `tests/web/e2e`,
  `tests/integration`. Frontend co-locates under `app/`; E2E is the single
  `tests/e2e/`.
- **`tests/workers/` stays flat** until a family reaches ~5 specs, then gets a
  domain dir (`tests/workers/mcp/` is the precedent).
- **`tests/e2e/` stays flat:** one spec file = one Playwright project, and every
  project's `testMatch` string literal must resolve to a real file in
  `tests/e2e/` (the gate checks this too).
- **Name specs after behavior, not sprints** (`estimate-range.spec.ts`, not
  `sprint2-s4.spec.ts`). Legacy sprint-named specs are grandfathered.

### Where shared infrastructure lives (NOT spec files)

```
tests/
  global-setup.ts        # E2E: wipe + migrate local D1 (Playwright globalSetup)
  seed-fixtures.ts       # E2E: optional multi-user seed (SEED_E2E=1)
  setup-web.ts           # web-unit hermeticity guard (setupFiles for vitest.config.ts)
  helpers/               # cross-suite helpers (e.g. dev-vars.ts)
  fixtures/              # payloads grouped by event family, versioned filenames
  unit/
    setup-client.ts      # setupFiles for vitest.api.config.ts
    db.ts, mocks.ts      # shared unit infra (better-sqlite3 harness, stubs)
    stubs/, helpers/
    <domain>/*.spec.ts   # ← the only place unit specs go
  workers/*.spec.ts
  e2e/
    *.spec.ts
    helpers/             # e2e-only helpers (csrf.ts, …)
```

## 2. Writing tests

### Web unit (`app/**/*.test.tsx`)

- Runs in **happy-dom**, hermetic — **no live worker**. The `tests/setup-web.ts`
  guard **fails any test that makes a real `fetch`**. A loader/action test must
  stub the network: `vi.stubGlobal('fetch', …)` (a stub replaces
  `globalThis.fetch`, so the guard is bypassed for hermetic tests). This exists
  because `getApiUrl()` falls back to `localhost:8788` and the BFF's
  graceful-degradation `catch` would otherwise swallow a real ECONNREFUSED and
  let the test pass while only ever exercising the error path.
  ⚠️ **8788 here is not a typo for the dev port and must not be "corrected" to
  8787.** It is the constant compiled into `app/lib/api.server.ts`, which is a
  different thing from where `npm run dev` listens. That the two disagree is a
  real defect in that fallback rather than in this sentence — the number is
  recorded here so a reader can tell the two apart.

### API / service unit (`tests/unit/<domain>/*.spec.ts`)

- Node env, `better-sqlite3` in-memory DB — no worker, no network. Use the shared
  `tests/unit/db.ts` harness and `tests/unit/mocks.ts` stubs.
- A file that needs a DOM opts in per-file with `// @vitest-environment happy-dom`
  (vitest v4 replacement for `environmentMatchGlobs`).
- Prefer asserting **service-layer** behavior directly over reconstructing HTTP.

### Worker-runtime (`tests/workers/*.spec.ts`)

- Runs in real `workerd` via `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`. Reserve this for
  behavior that only reproduces on the real runtime: Queue publish/consume,
  sweeper republish, DLQ writeback, Durable Objects. Bindings are declared inline
  in `vitest.workers.config.ts`.
- When a workers spec hand-maintains DDL (e.g. a `tenant_configs` table), assert
  it against the Drizzle schema instead of trusting a "keep in sync" comment —
  `tests/unit/platform/inline-ddl-schema-sync.spec.ts` is the pattern.

### Contract (`tests/contract/<party>/`)

A contract spec asks a different question from every other suite. A unit spec
asks *does this code do what we intended*; a contract spec asks *is what we
intended what the other side accepts*. When one goes red the fix is usually to
change our code, not the assertion.

The suite exists because of a measured failure. Six paths in the QuickBooks
integration had **never once worked in production** while the unit suite stayed
green, and all six share one cause: the tests supplied the upstream's answers.
A fabricated fault carried a code QuickBooks never returns; fixtures inserted
rows with a field production never sets; no fixture ever described a voided
invoice. A test that invents the response it asserts on can only prove the code
agrees with itself.

**Two halves, split by whether they need credentials.**

`*.contract.spec.ts` — **offline, runs in CI for everyone.** It checks our
outbound payloads against the third party's own published description of its
API. For QuickBooks that is four XSDs Intuit ships in its SDK repositories,
vendored under `tests/contract/qbo/vendor/` with their provenance and hashes in
`SOURCES.md`. It reads them as text rather than validating XML, because the REST
API is JSON and the mapping is name-for-name — and because, as
`intuit-schema.contract.spec.ts` pins, the schema requires **neither** of the
two fields whose absence broke every invoice push. Those rules live in the
type's prose, so the specs quote the prose verbatim; a refresh that rewords it
turns them red, which is the point.

`*.live.spec.ts` — **needs a connected sandbox, never runs in CI.** For the
things the offline half cannot reach in principle: fault CODES (`6240`, the
duplicate-name fault our ladder read as `6140` for its whole life, appears in no
schema), unsupported verbs, and character rules. It borrows the local
`qbo_connections` row and decrypts it exactly as the worker does — it mints
nothing and writes nothing back, and it will NOT refresh an expired token,
because a test that silently rotates your credentials is doing something a test
has no business doing.

`.githooks/pre-push` runs it when a push touches `server/services/qbo/`. Without
a sandbox it fails, names what is missing, and prints the opt-out:

```bash
SKIP_QBO_CONTRACT=1 git push   # announced in the output, never silent
```

That is deliberate. A silent skip is indistinguishable from a pass, and a gate
nobody can satisfy gets bypassed wholesale instead of argued with. Individual
specs skip (they do not pass) when there is no connection, so a run reports
`1 failed | 4 skipped` rather than four green ticks over nothing.

**Writing one.**

- Every fabricated upstream response is a bug waiting. Prefer a captured one,
  and say in a comment when and how it was captured.
- Assert on Intuit's words, not a paraphrase. `expect(doc).toContain('An
  invoice must have at least one line …')` fails usefully when the source
  changes; `expect(rules.invoiceNeedsLine).toBe(true)` cannot.
- Pair every negative claim with a positive control. "We send nothing
  undeclared" passes vacuously against a parser returning an empty set, so
  `intuit-schema.contract.spec.ts` checks the parser's own counts first.

**Refreshing a vendored schema** is a deliberate act, not a chore: follow
`tests/contract/qbo/vendor/SOURCES.md`, then read what went red.

### E2E (`tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`)

- **One spec = one Playwright project.** Register the project in
  `playwright.config.ts` with a `testMatch` pointing at the file. Projects run a
  few at a time (`workers: 3`) but still share ONE `wrangler dev` worker and ONE
  mutable D1, so a spec must never assume isolation it has not arranged.
- **Own the rows you write.** The `editor-seed` setup project mints one
  inspection **per editing project** (`EXCLUSIVE_SEED_PROJECTS` in
  `tests/e2e/helpers/editor-seed.ts`); `readEditorSeed()` resolves the caller's
  own from the running project name. Add your project to that list if it changes
  the inspection — the test is "does it write?", not "does it read the id?",
  because a reader sharing rows with a writer is equally broken and merely fails
  later. Projects that need only a login share one entry and have nothing to
  corrupt. Before this, ten projects shared one inspection and it worked only
  because nothing ran at the same time: SpeedMode's overlay opens while unrated
  items remain, and a concurrent spec rating those items left it with none.
- **Gate on hydration, not on markup.** The app is server-rendered, so `<main>`
  and a full item list are on screen before React attaches any handler — waiting
  for them proves the SSR shell arrived and nothing more. Use
  `awaitEditorInteractive` (or `awaitEditorShortcutsReady`, which also blurs, as
  `useKeyboard` ignores shortcuts while focus is in a field) from
  `tests/e2e/helpers/editor-ready.ts`. It retries an **idempotent** selection
  until the editor pane opens, so it ends as soon as the handler exists and
  cannot mask a real break — a broken editor never opens the pane at all.
- **Ordering & dependencies.** The `api` project runs **first**: it asserts
  `POST /api/auth/setup` returns a fresh 200 and creates the shared admin
  (`admin@autotest.com` / `Password123!`). Any project that logs in as that admin
  must declare `dependencies: ['api']` so it is runnable in isolation (otherwise
  login 401s — no workspace).
- **Auth is cookie-based.** Page loaders authenticate via the
  `__Host-inspector_token` HttpOnly cookie, not a Bearer header. RBAC is enforced
  on the API, not by page-level role redirects.
- **Serial-block masking.** A `test.describe.serial` block skips the rest of the
  block on the first failure — a later failure can hide behind an earlier one. When
  greening the suite, re-run the **full** suite on a **fresh build** (see below),
  not just the spec you touched.
- **Known-unwritable surfaces.** Some paths can't be driven end-to-end locally
  (e.g. Download-PDF needs a Browser Rendering binding that crashes the isolate
  when absent). Verify the reachable leg (the public-report render path) and keep
  the rest unit-covered; leave a comment saying why.
- **Skips must be honest.** A fully-skipped spec needs a `TODO(...)` naming its
  blocker. Do **not** silently `test.skip(!seededId)` on a seed that always
  400s — that reads as green while testing nothing (`report-gate.spec.ts` is a
  `describe.skip` with a TODO for exactly this reason).

### Type-level (`tests/**/*.spec-d.ts`)

- `expectTypeOf` / `assertType` checks. Collected only by `test:types`; the
  runtime configs ignore `.spec-d.ts`.

---

## 3. Initialization

### `.dev.vars` — `scripts/gen-e2e-dev-vars.mjs`

`wrangler dev` reads secrets from `.dev.vars`, and the specs read `SETUP_CODE`
from it via `tests/helpers/dev-vars.ts`. A fresh checkout has none, so the worker
boots without JWT keys and `/api/auth/setup` fails. The script provisions a
throwaway file and is **idempotent — it never overwrites an existing
`.dev.vars`** (your real local one is respected). Every value is freshly
generated; nothing is hard-coded:

| Key | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `SETUP_CODE` | `000000` | The specs post a fixed `verificationCode: '000000'`; a **documented test fixture**, not a secret. |
| `DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT` | `1` | The suite drives many logins from ONE IP; the limiter is 10/60s per IP and would flakily 429. Honored only by `checkRateLimit` when set; **defaults to enforced**, so no real deploy is affected. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | random 32 bytes | KDF input. |
| `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_V1` / `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_V1` | fresh ES256 (P-256) keypair | Single-line PEM (the keyring strips whitespace; `.dev.vars` is parsed line-by-line). |

### `globalSetup` — `tests/global-setup.ts` (E2E only)

Runs once before the Playwright suite. It:

1. `npm run db:migrate` (idempotent) so the schema is current.
2. Enumerates **every** table from `sqlite_master` and wipes them in one batch
   under `PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys = ON` (never a hand-maintained table list —
   that can't stay complete as the schema grows). `d1_migrations` and `_cf_*`
   bookkeeping are preserved so migrations stay applied.
3. Clears all local KV keys (setup codes, `pwchanged:*`, cached tenants).
4. If `SEED_E2E=1`, runs `seedFixtures()` (`tests/seed-fixtures.ts`) — a
   multi-user/multi-tenant seed the subsystem-C/D/E specs need. **Off by
   default** so the self-seeding `api`/`browser` specs still see a clean
   workspace.

It resolves the **same** wrangler config the `webServer` builds against
(`WRANGLER_CONFIG` > `wrangler.local.jsonc` > `wrangler.jsonc`) and targets the
`DB` **binding** (not a database name) via `-c` — an earlier bug executed against
a name absent from the config, so every DELETE errored silently and the DB was
never cleared.

### The E2E worker — `playwright.config.ts`

- `webServer`: `npm run build && wrangler dev -c build/server/wrangler.json
  --port 8789`, `reuseExistingServer: true`.
- **Stale-build trap:** because `reuseExistingServer` is true, a local run serves
  whatever `build/` already exists. To replicate CI's fresh run, clear state
  first:
  ```bash
  rm -rf build .wrangler/state && npm run test:e2e
  ```
- `retries: CI ? 2 : 0` — a backstop for transient WebSocket/Durable-Object blips
  in the collab specs. Locally 0, for fast honest feedback.

### CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**`verify` does no work of its own.** It is an aggregate job that waits on every
other job, so branch protection has one stable name to require. Its `if:
always()` plus an explicit result test is load-bearing: under the default
`success()` behaviour a SKIPPED or cancelled dependency would let it pass.

The jobs it waits on run in parallel:

| Job | Runs |
|---|---|
| `typecheck-app` | `type-check:app` → `type-check:tests` → `test:types` |
| `lint-eslint` | `lint:eslint` (the type-aware pass) |
| `lint-gates` | `lint:gates-full` (every conformance gate) → `db:check` |
| `test-unit` | `test:unit`, sharded 4 ways |
| `test-contract` | `test:contract` (offline half only — the live half never runs in CI) |
| `test-workers` | `test:workers` |
| `test-web` | `test:web`, sharded 4 ways |
| `build` | `build` → `check:bundle` |
| `e2e` | a 2-way matrix: `test:e2e` (seeded D1) and `test:e2e:seeded` (multi-user seed) |

`e2e` was once absent from `verify`'s `needs`, which left a red E2E run reading
green on the job branch protection keys off — the whole suite was advisory
without anyone deciding it should be. It costs `verify` the wait for the longest
job, which is the price of the name meaning what it says.

Every job that touches generated types runs `gen-version`, `i18n:compile:cached`
and `react-router typegen` first. CodeQL runs separately (`codeql.yml`).

---

## 4. Gotchas & anti-patterns (hard-won)

**Fake-green tests are the suite's worst failure mode.** A test that never
asserts, swallows the path it claims to cover, or skips itself silently reports
green while testing nothing. Three shapes to reject in review:

- **Silent conditional skip.** `test.skip(!seededId, …)` on a seed that always
  400s → every case skips forever, invisibly. If a precondition genuinely can't
  be met, that's a `TODO(...)`-annotated `describe.skip`, not a runtime skip that
  masquerades as a pass (this is why `report-gate.spec.ts` is a `describe.skip`).
- **Swallowed error path.** A web-unit test whose real `fetch` ECONNREFUSEs and
  is caught by the BFF's graceful-degradation `catch` passes while only ever
  exercising the error branch. The `tests/setup-web.ts` guard fails these — do
  not stub around it just to make it pass.
- **No-assert body.** A test that runs code but asserts nothing (or asserts a
  tautology). Every test must assert an observable outcome.

### A suite that only builds one deployment shape

**Twenty-two QuickBooks specs, and not one of them had ever run in standalone
mode.** Every spec built a valid env; only one valid env had ever been written
down. `qbo-oauth-callback.spec.ts` hardcoded `QBO_CLIENT_ID` /
`QBO_CLIENT_SECRET` / `QBO_ENV` — the platform-supplied shape — and every other
env in the domain descended from it. So the tenant-credential fallback in
`qbo-oauth.ts` had a false guard on every run and was dead code inside a green
suite. A real defect lived in that gap for the life of the feature: the CDC cron
read credentials straight off the Worker env, could never see a self-hosted
operator's, and logged `QBO not configured` at a deployment where they had
configured it.

Nothing was skipped and nothing failed. **The suite was complete for one of the
two products this repo ships.**

The rule, so a future author can apply it without knowing that story:

> **If any `if` in the code under test has one branch per deployment, the spec
> must construct two envs.** One env can only ever exercise one branch, and a
> branch never taken cannot fail.

If two envs are awkward to build, the seam is in the wrong place rather than the
test being too much trouble — `getDeploymentProfile` takes `ProfileEnv` rather
than `AppEnv` precisely so any caller holding an env can answer the question.
`tests/unit/helpers/qbo-deployment-envs.ts` is the worked example: `saasQboEnv`
and `standaloneQboEnv`, named after the deployment so a spec asks for "the
self-hosted case" instead of assembling one and hoping it resembles one.

**Never hand-build credential fixtures.** Not hand-written ciphertext, not
hand-filled env values standing in for stored secrets. Seal them with the
product's own writer (`sealSecrets`) and let the code under test open them the
way production does. A fixture that writes what it then reads proves the reader
agrees with the writer and nothing else — and fixtures supplying fields
production never supplies is the single shared cause behind the QuickBooks
defects that shipped without ever working. That includes MODE fixtures, not just
response fixtures: an env is a fixture too.

**Assert against the REAL contract, not a remembered one.** Specs rot when the
API moves under them and the symptom is a silent 400/404, not a red assertion:

- E-05 patched a nonexistent `PATCH /:id/results`; the real write path is
  `POST /:id/results/batch`. When a **seed step** returns 400/404, verify the
  route still exists before trusting the green further down — a dead route turns
  the whole spec into a no-op.
- Public-report status codes are contract and they differ: an **unpublished**
  inspection → **404** `Report not found`; a **published-then-unpublished** one →
  **403** `NOT_PUBLISHED`. Assert the exact code your setup produces; use a
  tolerant matcher only when both are legitimately reachable.

**Flake-retry discipline — retries hide real bugs if applied bluntly.**

- Retry **only** transient socket errors (`ECONNRESET`, `ECONNREFUSED`,
  `socket hang up`, `EPIPE`). A `401`, `429`, or assertion failure MUST throw
  immediately — retrying it converts a real regression into a slow flake. The
  collab login helper does exactly this (4 attempts, connection-error-only,
  backoff).
- The collab root cause was a **stale keep-alive socket** left after the
  WebSocket/Durable-Object-heavy editing spec; the next login reused the dead
  socket and ECONNRESET once. `retries: CI ? 2 : 0` is the backstop, not the fix.
- One shared runner IP trips the login limiter (10/60s) as a `429` — that is what
  `DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT` exists for, not something to paper over with retries.

**Publish crashes the isolate without a Browser Rendering binding.**
`POST /:id/publish` enqueues a PDF via `env.BROWSER.quickAction`; with no
`BROWSER` binding the worker dies with a 503 and
`The RPC receiver does not implement quickAction` / `worker restarted`. The
publish→PDF leg cannot be driven end-to-end locally — verify the public-report
render path instead and keep the Download-PDF FAB unit-covered.

## Quick reference

npm run test:web                       # web unit (happy-dom, hermetic)
npm run test:unit                      # api/service unit (node + better-sqlite3)
npm run test:workers                   # real workerd (queues, DOs)
npm run test:e2e                       # Playwright, seeds real D1
npm run test:e2e:seeded                # the multi-user-seed projects (playwright.seeded.config.ts)

npx playwright test --grep "estimate range"

# also seed the C/D/E multi-user fixtures:

```

**Why `directory = suite` at all.** A spec's home decides which config collects
it, so classification is a filesystem fact rather than a convention somebody has
to remember — and `npm run lint:tests` can then check it. The alternative,
tagging each spec with the suite it belongs to, puts the answer inside the file
that a misfiled spec is already wrong about, and no gate can see the
disagreement. Every config's `include` glob is the whole rule; read them
together with the table above and the layout is complete.
