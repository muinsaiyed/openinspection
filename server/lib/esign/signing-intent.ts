/**
 * Intent comes from an act, not from an artefact.
 *
 * Intent must come from a recorded user action, not
 * be inferred back from the fact that a signature image exists. The chain
 * required is three steps — the signer was PRESENTED agreement X at
 * version/hash Y, the signer TOOK an explicit signing action, the system
 * RECORDED a signature.
 *
 * ── What was missing ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Steps two and three were recorded: `signer.signed` carries the envelope's
 * content hash and the signature image hash, and the event's existence IS the
 * action.
 *
 * Step ONE was recorded nowhere. `request.viewed` is declared in the audit event
 * enum and in the audit service's event union, and had **zero writers** —
 * nothing had ever appended one. What did exist was `markViewedBySigner`, which
 * flips a status column: a flag, not a chained tamper-evident fact, and carrying
 * no hash at all. So the chain said "a signature was recorded against this hash"
 * with no record of the signer having been shown it.
 *
 * ── Why this reuses the audit chain instead of a new table ──────────────────
 * Two forms are acceptable: a dedicated `signing_intent_event`, or an existing
 * signing event that explicitly records the three
 * facts. This is the second, deliberately. `esign_audit_logs` is already
 * hash-chained and signed on every append, which is exactly the property an
 * intent record needs — a parallel table would have to earn that property again,
 * and would create a second answer to "what happened to this envelope".
 *
 * ── Why a missing hash is not a failure ─────────────────────────────────────
 * An envelope whose snapshot predates content hashing has no hash to compare.
 * Refusing there would block a signature for a reason about our own history
 * rather than about the signer. The honest answer is that the hash half cannot
 * be checked — so the PRESENTATION requirement still applies and the comparison
 * is skipped. The weaker check does not become no check.

/**
 * The audit event that records a presentation to ONE signer.
 *
 * Not `request.viewed`, which existed (with zero writers) and looked like the
 * obvious home. That event is ENVELOPE-level under the audit dedup index, which
 * excludes only `signer.%` — so on a two-signer envelope the first viewer's row
 * inserts and the second hits the unique constraint and gets the first signer's
 * row back. The chain would then show a presentation to somebody else, and the
 * second signer's intent would be resting on it. The dedup class is what makes
 * these two different events rather than one event with two readings.
