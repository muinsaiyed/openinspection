/**
 * Spec 3 Task 7b — portal request-link success state cold-trail recovery
 * guidance.
 *
 * When find-my-report/portal request-link matches nothing, the success state
 * previously went silent after "Check your inbox" — a client who mistyped or
 * used a different email would wait for an email that never arrives. Fix: a
 * match-agnostic guidance line rendered INSIDE the existing single success
 * state (no new "not found" branch — anti-enumeration is preserved because
 * the copy never reveals match status).
 *
 * This test asserts the guidance renders identically regardless of whether
 * the submitted email matched an account — there is no branch in the
 * component, so both cases exercise the exact same render path, but the
 * assertion is written per-submission to guard against a future regression
 * that reintroduces a match-status branch.
