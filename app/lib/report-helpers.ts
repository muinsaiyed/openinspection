 * bordered box containing nothing but the item's own title, which a recipient
 * cannot tell apart from "inspected, nothing to report". On an inspection report
 * that difference is the whole liability question, and it lands on the commonest
 * case there is: a report published before it was finished (19 of 36 production
 * inspections have no content at all).
 *
 * ⚠️ UNRATED IS NOT THE `Not Inspected` RATING. That one is an answer — the
 * component was there and the inspector says why they did not inspect it, and it
 * renders through `naKind` with its reason. This is the absence of an answer.
 *
 * WHY `type` GATES IT. Only `rich` items carry `ratingOptions`; a `number` /
 * `text` / `boolean` item ("Year built · 1995") is a data field and has no rating
 * to miss. Marking those "Unrated" would invent a gap. `type` is optional on the
 * wire and `rich` is the service's own default, so absent reads as rich.
