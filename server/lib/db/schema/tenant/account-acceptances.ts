/**
 * What the person accepted, recorded where the account was born.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT: an account and its acceptance are ONE write. The
 * mechanism this table exists to serve is deliberately not the obvious one: the
 * first design enqueued the acceptance atomically with the account insert and let
 * the portal ledger become consistent afterwards. That does NOT fail closed.
 * The distinction it misses is
 * between two things that design treated as one: an outbox proves *acceptance
 * evidence was durably captured*; it cannot prove *acceptance was recorded in the
 * acceptance ledger before account creation*. While the event sits unconsumed the
 * state is `account = EXISTS, acceptance_ledger = ABSENT`, which violates the
 * invariant no matter what the envelope contains.
 *
 * So rows here are written in the SAME `db.batch()` as the `users` row, and the
 * builder that produces them returns a statement rather than executing one, so
 * the caller can put it in its own batch. There is no path that writes an
 * acceptance on its own, and none that creates an account without one.
 *
 * ── One row per document, not one row with a list ───────────────────────────
 * A person accepts Terms and a Privacy notice as separate documents with separate
 * versions and separate hashes. Folding them into a JSON array would make "which
 * version of Terms did they accept" a query into a blob, and would let a partial
 * capture (one document present, one missing) look like a complete row. Separate
 * rows make the absence visible.
 *
 * ── The relationship to portal's `user_consents` ────────────────────────────
 * For an account born HERE, this table is the record and the portal ledger is a
 * projection of it. For an account born in the portal, the reverse: the portal
 * captured the acceptance and it travels in on the command. Whoever captured it
 * is authoritative; the other side projects. Both directions are real, and
 * confusing them is how a reader concludes one of them does not exist.
