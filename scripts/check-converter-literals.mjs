/**
 * Every string a converter embeds is CLASSIFIED, or this fails.
 *
 * ── Why this is a gate and not a review habit ───────────────────────────────
 * A converter reads somebody else's file, and the strings it holds are the one
 * place that somebody else's expression could end up in this repository. Four
 * classifications are permitted, and a literal that is none of them has no
 * standing at all — there is nothing to fall back on. A habit catches that on
 * the days somebody remembers; a gate catches it on the day they are pasting a
 * column list out of a real export at four in the afternoon.
 *
 * ── What it checks ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  A. Every module-level DECLARATION holding string literals — a `const` or a
 *     string-union `type` — must carry a classification directly above it.
 *     That is where an embedded vocabulary lives, and where a pasted list is
 *     most natural to put.
 *  B. Every literal MATCHED AGAINST file content — `=== '…'`, `.includes('…')`,
 *     `.startsWith('…')`, `.endsWith('…')` — must be covered: either it is a
 *     value of a classified declaration in the same file, or the line carries
 *     its own classification. A discriminator inlined at its use site is still
 *     a discriminator, and it is the form that escapes review.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO LENGTH RULE. "Shorter than N characters is safe" was proposed and
 * rejected outright: length is not the test. This gate classifies; it
 * does not measure. The one exemption is by NAME — the eight answers `typeof`
 * can give — because a JavaScript type name is not anybody's expression.
 *
 * ── What the corpus IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every `.ts` UNDER the two scanned directories, walked recursively, named one
 * per line on every run. Recursively because a converter written by hand is the
 * one most likely to be long, and therefore the one most likely to be split
 * into a folder — which the one-level walk this replaces never looked inside.
 *
 * ⚠️ It reads SOURCE. A conversion performed by a PERSON reading the original
 * file and writing the mapping out by hand is the case that most needs this
 * check — transcribing the section names and rating words in front of you is
 * the natural thing to do, and a parser has no such temptation — but it is only
 * in scope once that work lands here AS CODE. A conversion delivered as DATA,
 * a bundle uploaded through the delivery route, embeds no literals in this
 * repository, and this gate is silent about it by construction rather than by
 * omission. Do not read a pass here as a statement about one.
