/**
 * Who sent it, and on whose behalf — two questions, both recorded.
 *
 * The number's owner is not automatically the legal sender.
 * In the default mode a message leaves OUR shared number carrying the TENANT's
 * brand, so "who initiated this" and "on whose behalf was it sent" have
 * different answers, and neither should have to be reconstructed from the
 * database months later by inferring it from `sms_mode`.
 *
 * The naming here is deliberate and is not a style choice.
 * `server/lib/email/sender-identity.ts` already exports `resolveSenderIdentity`
 * with a different signature and a different return type. Two exports of the
 * same name in sibling domain folders are distinguishable only by their import
 * path — which is the one thing a reader does not see in a diff of the call
 * site. So the SMS side is `resolveSmsSenderIdentity` returning
 * `SmsSenderIdentity`, and the email side is left alone: it is shipped, it has
 * its own spec, and renaming a live export to make room for a new one bills the
 * cost to the wrong side.
