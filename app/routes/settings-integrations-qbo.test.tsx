/**
 * The settings page must believe the API when it says a company is connected.
 *
 * This page used to decide that question with `status?.connected`, reading a
 * field the API has never sent: the route hand-declared its own `QboStatus`
 * shape carrying a `connected: boolean` and cast the JSON body to it, while
 * the value actually on the wire is `QBOConnectionStatus`, which has no such
 * field. The flag was therefore permanently `undefined`, so a fully connected
 * tenant saw the "Connect QuickBooks" call-to-action and could never reach
 * Sync, Pause, Disconnect, the refresh-token expiry warning, or Books Health.
 * Nothing caught it: fourteen server specs exercise the integration, and none
 * of them crosses the seam where the shape is retyped by hand.
 *
 * So the payload below is typed as the SERVER's return type. If a future
 * change adds a field the page needs, or renames one it reads, this stops
 * compiling — which is the protection the hand-written interface gave up.
