/**
 * Large-file ratchet gate (anti-monolith).
 *
 * Flags source files over MAX_LINES. Files already over the limit are
 * grandfathered in `scripts/file-size-baseline.json` with their current line
 * count as a CAP — the ratchet only tightens:
 *   - a NEW file over the limit              → FAIL
 *   - a grandfathered file GROWS past its cap → FAIL
 *   - a grandfathered file SHRINKS            → OK (run `--update` to lock the lower cap)
 *
 * Splitting a file is the intended fix; bumping the baseline is a deliberate,
 * reviewed escape hatch (same philosophy as db:check's KNOWN_ACCEPTED and the
 * bundle-size cap). Generated files and tests are excluded.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-file-size.mjs            # gate (CI + pre-commit via `lint`)
 *   node scripts/check-file-size.mjs --update   # regenerate the baseline snapshot
