/**
 * The route contracts for the statutory-form endpoints. Handlers live beside
 * them in `statutory.ts`.
 *
 * -- WHY THEY ARE SEPARATED ---------------------------------------------------
 * `statutory.ts` reached the 400-line ceiling, and this is the seam that
 * survives the file growing again: a route declaration is a CONTRACT -- path,
 * verb, role, request shape, the status codes and what each one means -- while
 * a handler is the behaviour that honours it. They change for different reasons
 * and are read by different people. The published OpenAPI document is generated
 * from this file alone; someone auditing what this software exposes, or what
 * scope and tier reach it, has one file to read and no request handling in the
 * way of it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Every `operationId` here appears in `server/lib/mcp/openapi-snapshot.json`.
 * Changing one is an API-surface change and the snapshot has to be regenerated
 * with it (`npm run mcp:snapshot`), or `tests/unit/mcp/snapshot-drift.spec.ts`
 * fails -- which is the point of that test.

 * The offer answers "is there a form here, and what does the notice say" from
 * the catalogue and one row, and the inspection hub calls it on every page
 * load. Coverage has to gather every input the renderer would -- results,
 * facts, credentials, overflow instances -- to answer honestly. Putting the two
 * behind one path would make every hub load pay for an answer it does not
 * display, and on 2026-09-05 production was measurably killing ordinary page
 * loads at the free tier's CPU limit. Cheap questions and expensive ones get
 * their own paths so a caller can choose.
 *
 * The answer is deliberately the SAME LIST the download refuses with -- see
 * `missingRequiredFields`. A second opinion here would read complete over a
 * form that will be refused, and a checklist is believed.

 * The PREVIEW route, read by the editor while the inspection is still open.
 *
 * Same document, same bindings, same revision judgement -- and deliberately NOT
 * the same preconditions. It does not require a published report version, which
 * is the whole reason it exists: until now the only way to see whether a value
 * landed in the right box on an authority's fixed layout was to publish the
 * report to the client and download the deliverable, so an inspector paid an
 * irreversible, client-visible act for a look at their own work.
 *
 * Two things make dropping that precondition safe rather than convenient:
 * nothing is written -- `recordProduction` is not called, so no production row
 * claims a document that was never handed over -- and every page is stamped
 * NOT FOR SUBMISSION, because the bytes themselves are the only thing that can
 * still say so once they leave the browser.
 *
 * ⚠️ It is a different PATH, not a query flag on the deliverable. A `?preview=1`
 * would put "is this filed" and "is this watermarked" behind a parameter that
 * any caller can omit or mistype, and the failure mode of getting it wrong is
 * either a watermark on a real submission or a clean copy of unfinished work.
 * Two paths cannot be confused by a typo.
