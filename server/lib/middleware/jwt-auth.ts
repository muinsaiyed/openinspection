/**
 * Global JWT middleware — resolves tenantId / userRole from a Bearer token or
 * the `__Host-inspector_token` cookie, then injects the tenant-scoped DB.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in the composition root for a reason that is not
 * cosmetic: `server/index.ts` imports every route module, and type-aware linting
 * a file with that import fan-in exhausts a 6GB heap (measured: SIGABRT at 4GB
 * after 91s, at 6GB after 189s), so the entry file is exempt from type-aware
 * rules in eslint.config.js. This is authentication code — cross-tenant guard,
 * token invalidation, ScopedDB injection — and it must stay under
 * `no-floating-promises` and the rest of the typed rule set. Anything
 * security-bearing belongs on this side of that line, not in the entry.
 *
 * ORDERING (A-16): registered after contextBootstrap / tenantRouter / branding
 * (which resolve host- and slug-derived context) and before
 * integrationSecretsMiddleware + diMiddleware (both tenant-scoped, so they must
 * see the tenantId this sets). `tests/unit/platform/middleware-order.spec.ts`
 * pins that position.

 * path ends in one of those extensions skipped authentication entirely, before
 * a token was even read.
 *
 * Measured on `/api/inspections/{id}/statutory-form.pdf`: the middleware
 * returned early, `userRole` was never set, and the route's own `requireRole`
 * answered 401 'No role found in context' -- so an inspector pressing Download
 * on a statutory form got an error, on every workspace, always. That one failed
 * CLOSED, which is why it read as a broken button rather than as this.
 *
 * The shape that does NOT fail closed is the same rule on a route that reads
 * `tenantId` without demanding a role: in standalone the tenant resolves from
 * the host, so such a route would have answered with real data and no session
 * at all. Naming one is not the point -- the point is that adding a `.json`
 * endpoint would have opened it silently, and nothing here would have said so.
 *
 * Static assets are served by the Cloudflare assets layer before this worker
 * runs; what reaches here under an asset extension is either a miss or an API
 * route wearing a file name. Neither is a reason to skip authentication.
