/**
 * Shared repair-defect flatten helper.
 *
 * Used by the Interactive Repair Request Builder source endpoint
 * (`server/api/repair-builder.ts`) to flatten the report defect list into
 * a stable, keyed format.
 *
 * The RRB shape omits estimateLow/estimateHigh (RRB is pure-credit). We add
 * a stable `findingKey` so the builder can key its items against the report.
 *
 * "Omits" is literal: the fields are not on `RepairDefect` and are not copied in
 * `flattenReportDefects` below. They were on both for a while, with this same
 * sentence sitting above them, and the builder used them to offer the client a
 * one-click "use the report's estimate" credit — so the comment described an
 * invariant the file broke two screens later. The only credit figure in the RRB
 * is one the client typed.
