/**
 * A workspace's AI settings, and the statement it made about its own key.
 *
 * ## Why these are not columns on `tenant_configs`
 *
 * They were, until these tables existed — seventeen of them, on a table that
 * had reached one hundred columns. D1 will not create a table wider than that,
 * so the next AI field could not be added at all: the ceiling was reached by a
 * subsystem that keeps growing, sitting in a table it shares with booking,
 * branding, legal and PDF settings that do not grow at the same rate.
 *
 * Width was the trigger, not the reason. `tenant_configs` is FK-referenced,
 * which on D1 means a column can only ever be APPENDED — every AI field there
 * carried a comment saying so, and the reading order of that table stopped
 * matching its subject matter long ago. These tables are referenced by nothing,
 * so a field goes where it belongs and the file reads in the order a person
 * would explain it.
 *
 * ## Why TWO tables and not one
 *
 * The two halves are different KINDS of fact, and only the split makes that
 * legible:
 *
 *   `tenant_ai_configs` is current settings — overwritten in place, and only
 *   the present value means anything. Written by the settings page.
 *
 *   `tenant_ai_attestations` is a dated STATEMENT the workspace made, against a
 *   named revision of terms it was shown. Written by the secrets save, in the
 *   same `db.batch()` as the key it is about.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The attestation is still one row per workspace, overwritten on
 * re-attestation, exactly as it behaved as columns.** That is deliberate: this
 * change moves these fields and changes nothing about what they mean, because a
 * relocation that also altered semantics would leave no way to tell which half
 * broke something. But a record whose whole value is "what was said, and when"
 * is a poor fit for a shape that keeps only the latest — re-attesting discards
 * the previous statement, including the terms revision it was made against.
 * Making this append-only is the change the split was the prerequisite for; it
 * is not this change.
 *
 * ## What did NOT come across
 *
 * Seven of the seventeen columns were declared and never wired, and they were
 * left behind rather than carried into a new table, because moving a field
 * nothing writes only relocates the question of whether it should exist:
 *
 *   `ai_provider_kind` — an enum with one member; no code path ever set it.
 *   `ai_key_attestation_endpoint` / `_model` / `_service_tier` /
 *   `_intended_use` / `_config_version` — the "record the destination, not just
 *   the key" half of the attestation. `AiKeyAttestationRecord` carries none of
 *   these fields, so the secrets save could not write them even in principle;
 *   the only thing that ever set them was a spec that inserted them with
 *   Drizzle and asserted they came back.
 *
 * The seventh, `ai_config_version`, DID come across — production code bumps it
 * on every save. Its READER is what was never built: nothing passes a version
 * to `recordProvenance`, so `ai_call_provenance.config_version` is NULL on
 * every row, and the join that was supposed to answer "which configuration was
 * in force when this data was processed" has no left-hand side. The counter is
 * kept because removing it is a product decision; the gap is recorded here so
 * the next person reads a fact instead of a promise.
 *
 * Neither table declares `.references()`. Per the repo's schema rules a
 * referenced table can never be rebuilt on D1, and being referenced by nothing
 * is what buys these tables the freedom the one they came from lost. Rows are
 * removed by the tenant purge path in the service layer, like every other
 * tenant-scoped table.

/**
 * What a workspace stated about its own AI provider key, and when.
 *
 * Recorded verbatim from the secrets save. Nothing here is measured or
 * verified, and the distinction is the whole point of the table:
 *
 *   - It proves that, at a stated moment and against a named revision of the
 *     terms it was shown, the workspace asserted these facts. That is a record
 *     of what was represented, and its evidential value is exactly that.
 *   - It does NOT prove the key was usable, that the provider account is what
 *     was claimed, or that the content sent was the content described. Only
 *     `ai_call_provenance` speaks to what actually ran, and it speaks by
 *     observation, off the adapter instance.
 *
 * Reading a row here as evidence of what happened, rather than of what was
 * claimed, is the one misuse it must not be put to.
 *
 * **A row exists exactly when an attested key is on file.** That is the shape
 * change worth noticing: as six nullable columns, "attested" meant all six
 * non-null together, an invariant no constraint could hold and every reader had
 * to re-check. Here the row IS the attestation — clearing the key deletes it,
 * because a statement outliving the credential it was made about would read as
 * covering a key nobody attested to.
