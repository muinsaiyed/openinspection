/**
 * Putting a signature image inside a box somebody measured on an official form.
 *
 * ── Three separate ways a signature goes wrong, all of them quiet ────────────
 * A format this renderer cannot embed passes a data-URI check and is stored,
 * because the HTML surfaces that draw the same signature accept it happily; the
 * failure arrives later and somewhere else. A box and a mark almost never share
 * proportions, and `drawImage` given both a width and a height honours both, so
 * the mark comes out stretched — a document that prints, looks complete, and
 * carries a signature nobody wrote. And an image with too few pixels for the
 * space is simply blurred onto the page with nothing said. None of the three
 * raises anything by itself, so all three are decided here.
 *
 * ── Fit, then refuse, exactly as the text does ───────────────────────────────
 * `fit.ts` fits an answer to the row, shrinks it to a floor somebody measured,
 * and refuses loudly rather than clipping. A signature gets the same treatment
 * for the same reason: scaling it down to nothing, or up into mush, is a slower
 * way of losing it, and a mark nobody can read on a statutory form is worse than
 * a form that refused to build.
 *
 * ── This module does no I/O and holds no pdf-lib types ──────────────────────
 * `renderStatutoryForm` is pure and stays pure. Everything here is arithmetic
 * over two pairs of numbers — the image's pixel dimensions, which the caller
 * already has from embedding it, and the box, which the field map declares.
 * That is also what lets Settings show an inspector the SAME verdict before
 * anything is rendered, rather than a second implementation that agrees with
 * this one until it does not.
 */

/**
 * The image formats a stored signature may be in.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS A PROPERTY OF pdf-lib, NOT A PREFERENCE. It embeds PNG and JPEG.
 * There is no third format and there is no vector one, so an SVG signature is
 * not a slightly worse signature here — it is a signature that cannot be drawn
 * at all, at the moment an inspector presses send.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS THIS RENDERER THAT IS STRICT, AND IT DECIDES FOR ALL OF THEM. The
 * agreement copy and the report are HTML, where an SVG data URI displays fine —
 * so nothing downstream of storage would ever have objected. One stored
 * signature feeds every surface, so the narrowest surface owns the list, and the
 * upload validation imports it rather than keeping a second copy. Two copies,
 * only one of them ever revisited, is how `svg+xml` got accepted in the first
 * place.

 *

 * How many image pixels each point of the drawn box must be given.
 *
 * ── Why a ratio and not a pixel count ───────────────────────────────────────
 * "At least 300 pixels wide" is right for exactly one box and wrong for every
 * other one. What determines whether a mark reads is how many pixels land on
 * each point of paper, so that is what is stated — the same shape as the font
 * floor in `fit.ts`, which is a size and not a character count.
 *
 * ── Why 2 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A point is 1/72 inch, so 1 px/pt IS 72 DPI — screen resolution, put on paper.
 * That is not a judgement call: at or below it a thin high-contrast line drawing
 * (which is all a signature is) visibly breaks into steps. 2 px/pt is 144 DPI,
 * the first whole multiple clear of that, with a stroke's width of margin.
 *
 * ── Why NOT 300 DPI, the print-artwork standard ─────────────────────────────
 * Because it would refuse this product's own output. `SignaturePad` draws on a
 * 400x150 canvas, and the signature boxes measured on these forms run around
 * 160x40 points, which places the pad's own mark at 3.75 px/pt — under a 300 DPI
 * (4.167 px/pt) floor. A gate that refuses the only signature most inspectors
 * will ever have is a gate that gets routed around rather than met. 2 sits above
 * screen resolution and below what we ourselves produce, so it fires only on a
 * mark that genuinely came from somewhere else: a thumbnail, a cropped-to-death
 * scan, an image lifted off a web page.
