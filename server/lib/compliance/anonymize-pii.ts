 * The SINGLE source of truth for the column→value mapping used when anonymizing
 * the satellite PII on a signed agreement envelope + its signer rows. Both the
 * erasure orchestrator (`erasure-orchestrator.ts`, on a DSAR) and the retention
 * sweep (`retention-sweep.ts`, the past-window data-minimization clock) consume
 * these so the two paths CANNOT drift: a row anonymized by an erase first and
 * then swept (or vice-versa) lands byte-identical values ('[erased]' sentinel
 * for NOT NULL columns, NULL for nullable ones — no double-mangling).
 *
 * The orchestrator KEEPS `signature_base64` (it is the retained evidence); the
 * sweep additionally NULLs it. That single differing column is layered on at the
 * sweep call-site, NOT here, so this module stays the pure satellite-PII set.
