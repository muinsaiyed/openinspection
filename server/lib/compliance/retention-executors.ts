/**
 * One executor per manifest table — the statements that actually expire rows.
 *
 * Split out of `retention-logs.ts` when that file crossed the 400-line gate.
 * The seam is the one the code already had: everything here answers "what SQL
 * retires a row of THIS table", and knows nothing about how a sweep is
 * sequenced, how failures are reported, or what a summary looks like;
 * everything left there is the sweep and knows nothing about any table.
 *
 * Keyed by DB table name so the manifest stays the single list of what is
 * governed, and a rule whose table has no executor is a rule that silently does
 * nothing. `retention-logs.spec.ts` asserts the two sets match in BOTH
 * directions: a rule with no executor is a retention promise nothing keeps, and
 * an executor with no rule is a delete statement running on a period nobody
 * wrote down.
 *
 * ── Every table here has a tenant, and every executor uses it ───────────────
 * This file holds the `tenant_scoped` half of the catalogue. Each statement
 * ends with `notHeld(<table>.tenantId, ctx)`, which is how the global
 * invariant — a legal hold outranks every scheduled deletion — is actually
 * enforced. The tenant-less rules live in `retention-executors-platform.ts`,
 * where a hold cannot be expressed as a filter and is handled by the driver
 * instead.
