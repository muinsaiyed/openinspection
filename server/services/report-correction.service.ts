/**
 * Correcting a report that has already been delivered.
 *
 * A published report is signed and hash-chained, and people rely on the copy
 * they were given. Rewriting it in place would destroy the difference between
 * HISTORICAL AUTHENTICITY — what was delivered, and that it verifies — and
 * CURRENT CORRECTNESS, which is what a correction is about. So a correction
 * publishes a NEW version through the amendment machinery that already exists
 * (`ReportVersionService.snapshotOnPublish`: `isAmendment` for v >= 2,
 * `prevHash` chaining to the previous content hash, `summary` carrying the
 * reason) and never touches the row it supersedes.
 *
 * The correction is not finished when one row changes. The stored deliverables
 * for the same inspection — the signed PDF, the certificate and the evidence
 * zip — are still being served, so they stop describing themselves as current
 * the moment the amendment lands. That is `resolveArtifactStatus`, read by the
 * three download helpers; nothing here has to stamp the objects.
