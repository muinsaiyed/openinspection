/**
 * Marketplace library fixtures — globally seeded entries available to all
 * tenants via the marketplace import flow.
 *
 * The marketplace_libraries table is intentionally NOT tenant-scoped — it
 * is a catalogue of importable content. Idempotency in the starter-content
 * seeder is enforced by `(name)` uniqueness; running the seed on a system
 * that already has these libraries is a no-op.
 *
 * THE PACK IS DERIVED, NOT RESTATED. Its rows, its category list and its count
 * all come from `CANNED_COMMENTS` — the same 250 entries the starter-content
 * service seeds directly into a new trial tenant. Two hand-maintained copies of
 * one library is how they drift, and this file is the proof: it shipped with
 * `entries: []` under a key the importer does not read (`parseLibraryComments`
 * reads `comments`), so the catalogue advertised a featured pack that imported
 * as ZERO ROWS. Its prose was wrong in three further ways that nobody could see
 * while the array was empty — it named a severity vocabulary the product does
 * not use ("satisfactory / monitor / defect" against the canonical
 * good / marginal / significant), claimed six categories where the data has
 * thirteen, and called 250 entries "small".
