/**
 * Installing a statutory package is refused while the authority's PDF is
 * missing.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is the only marketplace behaviour that depends on the published catalogue,
 * which has to be mocked at the module: no statutory form ships with this
 * software (`PUBLISHED_FORM_VERSIONS` is empty by declaration), so a real run
 * has nothing to require bytes for. Mocking it inside the other marketplace
 * specs would change what every unrelated test in them is measuring.
 *
 * ── THE PAIR ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "Refuses when the bytes are absent" is satisfied perfectly by an install that
 * refuses everything, so "installs when the bytes are present" sits beside it
 * and is not optional. Both assert on what reached the DATABASE, because the
 * failure this gate exists for is a workspace that believes it installed
 * something: a refusal that still wrote the import marker would reproduce it
 * exactly.
