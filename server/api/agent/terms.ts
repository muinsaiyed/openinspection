/**
 * How a signed-in agent accepts the agent terms.
 *
 * Signup collects the acceptance for an account being born. This is the same act
 * for an account that already exists — someone who signed up before there was a
 * document, or who is holding an acceptance of words that have since been
 * replaced. Without it the gate in `server/lib/middleware/agent-terms-gate.ts`
 * would be a wall rather than a door, so this endpoint is on that gate's short
 * exemption list and this file and that one have to be read together.
 *
 * The text IN FORCE is not served here. `GET /api/agent-signup/terms` already
 * returns the version, the hash and the body in force, and it is public because
 * the signup page has to render it before anyone has an account. A second read
 * endpoint would be a second thing to keep in step with the registry, for no new
 * fact.
 *
 * `GET /terms/history` below is a different question and therefore a different
 * endpoint: not "what is in force" but "what did THIS agent accept, and when".
 * Its answer is per-account, so it can never be public, and the bodies it
 * returns are the ARCHIVED ones — the text each acceptance actually named, not
 * whatever is current.

 * account is the one in the session and there is nothing for a caller to say
 * about it, so there is nothing to get wrong: an endpoint that accepted a user
 * id would be one bad authorization check away from answering for somebody else.
 *
 * Exempt from the agent-terms gate, like `/accept-terms`. This comment used to
 * say the opposite — that the exemption list is for the ways OUT of the gate and
 * that an agent who owes an acceptance is simply sent to accept it first. The
 * list is not only for the ways out: it is also for the mechanisms a gate must
 * not price at a signature, and a person's own record of what they signed is
 * one. Refusing it until they accept is a loop, and it lands hardest on the
 * agent who believes they already signed and wants to check.
 *
 * The exemption is from the GATE, not from authentication. The handler below
 * checks the session itself, for the reason `/accept-terms` does: the JWT
 * middleware does not reject a token-less request, it simply sets nothing.
