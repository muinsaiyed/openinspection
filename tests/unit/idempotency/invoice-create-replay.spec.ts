/**
 * Tier 1 of the burn-down: creating an invoice is a money document. A retried
 * POST that writes a second row does not just duplicate a record — it doubles
 * what the tenant believes is owed, and (when QuickBooks is connected) pushes
 * the duplicate out to their books where a human has to unpick it.
 *
 * The route is tenant-authenticated, so `app.use('*', idempotencyGuard)` in
 * server/index.ts already sits in front of it (order pinned by
 * tests/unit/platform/middleware-order.spec.ts). What that mount does NOT tell
 * you is whether the endpoint's side effects all happen INSIDE the guard's
 * span: the QBO push is fired through `executionCtx.waitUntil` from the
 * handler, and a side effect scheduled outside the guarded window would repeat
 * on every replay while the invoice row correctly did not.
 *
 * So this drives the REAL router behind the REAL middleware over a real
 * (in-memory) D1 schema, and counts rows and provider calls rather than
 * trusting the 201.
