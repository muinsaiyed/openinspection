/**
 * InspectionDocDO — One Durable Object instance per inspection.
 *
 * Holds the authoritative Y.Doc for collaborative results editing.
 * Uses the WebSocket Hibernation API (ctx.acceptWebSocket) so idle DOs
 * do not bill. The DO is data-only: awareness/presence stays in
 * InspectionPresenceDO.
 *
 * POC fixes applied (see poc/181-yjs-collab:workers/poc-collab-do.ts):
 *   1. Hydration in the constructor via ctx.blockConcurrencyWhile() — a
 *      hibernation-reconstructed DO is never empty when the first
 *      webSocketMessage fires (POC only hydrated in fetch(), too late).
 *   2. Awareness entirely dropped — byte0=1 path removed; this DO is
 *      data-only (presence lives in InspectionPresenceDO).
 *   3. Task-5 seam — persist() is a named method so Task 5 can extend it
 *      to also write the projected results to D1 (without touching the DO
 *      sync or hydration logic).
 *
 * WebSocket message framing:
 *   byte 0 = 0 → sync (y-protocols/sync message: step1 / step2 / update)
 *   (byte 0 = 1 was awareness — dropped in this production DO)
 *   byte 0 = 2 → restore (a bare control frame, no body): the authoritative doc
 *                was replaced by a version restore. The DO only SENDS this; it
 *                tells every connected client to drop its local state and resync
 *                from scratch (Yjs updates are additive/union, so a plain update
 *                broadcast cannot revert deletions on a live client — see #181
 *                Task 12b). Unknown inbound framing bytes are silently dropped.
 *
 * Identity: tenantId + inspectionId are passed in request headers by the
 * authorized route (Task 5). The DO reads them for logging only and never
 * trusts the WebSocket client for auth.
