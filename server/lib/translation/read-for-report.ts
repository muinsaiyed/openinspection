/**
 * The READ side: what a reader is handed alongside an English report.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in `server/api/public-report.ts` because that route is
 * at its large-file cap — and because the rule this implements is not a routing
 * rule. It is the same rule the storage schema states, applied at the one
 * moment both hashes are in hand.
 *
 * ## Three invariants, and each is a test
 *
 *  1. **Never render a translation whose `english_hash` does not match.**
 *     Withhold it. A reader shown a translated finding the inspector has since
 *     corrected is worse off than a reader shown no translation at all, and the
 *     asymmetry is deliberate: withholding one that was in fact still accurate
 *     is visible and repairable, serving a stale one is silent and reaches the
 *     client.
 *  2. **The reader path reads stored rows ONLY. It never consults the tenant
 *     setting.** A loader that asked "is translation enabled for this
 *     workspace?" before showing the toggle would silently strip the
 *     translation from every report already delivered, the moment somebody
 *     changed a setting. Production is gated; consumption is not.
 *  3. **The segment count must still line up.** Segments are re-inserted
 *     POSITIONALLY, so a stored list that no longer matches the segmenter's
 *     output for this payload is refused rather than mapped. The hash check
 *     above should already have caught that, and this is the cheap second
 *     answer to the case where it did not — mapping translated prose onto the
 *     wrong components produces a document that reads correctly and describes
 *     the wrong house.
 *
 * ## The notice travels with it, and never through it
 *
 * Every payload carries the notice, resolved through the reviewed-constant
 * register. Nothing here can produce that text: it is the sentence that says
 * which document is the record, so it must not pass through the machinery it
 * describes.
