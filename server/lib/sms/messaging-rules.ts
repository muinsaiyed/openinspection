/**
 * Jurisdictional messaging rules — what a message owes, and where that comes from.
 *
 * Split out of `send-gate.ts` when that file crossed the 400-line gate, and the
 * seam is the right one: everything here answers "what does the law require in
 * this place", and everything left in the gate answers "may THIS message go to
 * THIS person right now". The first changes when a statute is read; the second
 * changes when the product does.
 *
 * ── There is no wildcard, and that is the whole design ──────────────────────
 * `rulesFor` refuses a jurisdiction it has no rule for. A country-level fallback
 * would be the failure this table exists to prevent: it would let the rule
 * studied for one place answer for a place nobody has studied, silently, and the
 * answer would look as authoritative as a real one.
 *
 * ── `unknown` is a value, and it fails closed ───────────────────────────────
 * "The provision does not reach this" and "we have not read it" are different
 * facts and must never collapse into one. Recording the second as the first is
 * precisely the error this repository made once with Washington — concluding a
 * state had an exemption because a neighbouring state's summary said so — and
 * once with a TCPA quiet-hours range written wider than the statute.
 *
 * The register in `compliance/messaging-rules.jsonc` carries the citations, the
 * date each was checked, and whether it was read from PRIMARY TEXT or a
 * secondary source; `lint:messaging-rules` compares this table against it in
 * both directions and prints the unverified count every run.

 * The enforceable half of `compliance/messaging-rules.jsonc`.
 *
 * ── Why the values are duplicated out of the register ────────────────────────
 * A Worker has no filesystem, so the register cannot be read at runtime. The
 * honest options were to keep the citations in code (where nobody maintaining a
 * legal record would look for them) or to keep the enforceable values here and
 * make the drift a build failure. `lint:messaging-rules` does the second: it
 * parses this literal, compares all four values of every rule against the
 * register, and fails on any rule present in one and not the other. So this is
 * a projection of that file, never a second opinion about the law.
 *
 * ── Why it is written in a shape a script can parse ──────────────────────────
 * The gate extracts this object literal and parses it. It tolerates quoted and
 * unquoted keys and both quote styles, so ordinary formatting is safe — but the
 * leaf values must stay simple string literals. Do not introduce a computed
 * key, a spread or a helper call here; put the reasoning in the register.
 *
 * KEY FORMAT: `${country}/${region ?? '-'}`. `US/CA` is California and `CA/-`
 * is Canada, which is exactly the collision the two-field `Jurisdiction` and
 * this explicit `-` exist to keep visible.
