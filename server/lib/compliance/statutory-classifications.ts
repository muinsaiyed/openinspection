/**
 * Statutory classifications — the legal readings, kept apart from the manifest.
 *
 * Split out of `erasure-out-of-scope.ts` because both compliance files had
 * reached their line ceiling with zero headroom, and because the separation is
 * the right one anyway rather than an arithmetic convenience.
 *
 * ── Why these are not fields on `ErasureRule` ───────────────────────────────
 * `ErasureRule.category` carries an explicit instruction NOT to be cited
 * downstream as a legal determination. `statutory_basis` and `basis_kind` ARE
 * legal determinations, sourced to an external ruling. One row carrying both is
 * exactly the confusion already removed from the action and category labels;
 * reintroducing it one field lower would be the same error at a smaller scale.
 *
 * The vocabulary is snake_case, matching the jurisdiction registry rather than
 * the manifest's camelCase, so the two axes cannot be read as one.
 *
 * ── The state that matters is "not judged yet" ──────────────────────────────
 * `review_status` distinguishes an external ruling from an engineering reading
 * from an entry nobody has assessed. A `not_assessed` entry may carry NO basis
 * and NO basis_kind: a half-filled classification is the one that reads as a
 * decision. `classification-basis.spec.ts` checks the census in, prints it every
 * run, and NAMES the non-ruled entries rather than counting them.
 */

/**
 * A US-statutory classification of ONE column: the statute read, the kind of
 * answer it produced, and what would make it stop holding. Deliberately NOT a
 * field on `ErasureRule` — `category` there is OUR governance label, which its
 * own doc comment forbids citing as a legal determination, while these entries
 * ARE a reading of the law, sourced to an external ruling.
 *  - `basis_kind` — `statutory_exclusion` (the definition excludes what we
 *    hold) · `architecture_dependent` (only our own code keeps us out
 *    of it — `exif_data`, same statute) · `conditional` (turns on a named axis).
 *  - `review_status` — WHO judged it: a ruled entry carries a ruling id, every
 *    other state carries `open_question` and NO statutory classification, so a
 *    half-filled entry cannot read as a decided one.
 *  - `erasure_coverage` — the governing manifest rule, or `gap` where consumer
 *    erasure has none; a gap is not "never deleted", which `reached_by` says.
 *    The spec below counts each state and each gap out loud, either way.
