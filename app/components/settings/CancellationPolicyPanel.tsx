/**
 * The company cancellation ladder, and the agreement clause it depends on.
 *
 * WHY THE CLAUSE IS IN THIS PANEL AND NOT ON THE AGREEMENTS PAGE. A fee is only
 * collectable because the signed agreement says it is — so the two facts are one
 * decision, and splitting them across two screens produces the state this panel
 * exists to make impossible: a configured fee whose clause nobody confirmed. The
 * server refuses that combination outright (`BrandingService.updateBranding`);
 * what a person needs here is to see WHY before the refusal, and to fix it in the
 * same save. The API applies the attestation before the policy for exactly that
 * reason.
 *
 * FOUR CLAUSE STATES, NOT A CHECKBOX. `clauseStateOf` returns
 * not-required / never-attested / attested / drifted, and the fourth is the one
 * that justifies the shape. `getCancellationAttestation` compares the attested
 * version against the agreement's CURRENT version, so editing the agreement —
 * for any reason, including a typo — clears the confirmation. That is correct and
 * it is surprising, so the drifted copy says it outright rather than leaving an
 * operator to discover it as a failed save.
 *
 * ⚠️ `current` is computed on the SERVER and shipped in the branding payload. Do
 * NOT derive it here from the raw columns plus the agreement list: that is a
 * second copy of the invalidation rule, and the copy the panel shows would
 * eventually disagree with the one the fee gate reads.
 *
 * WHAT IT REUSES, deliberately. `SegmentedControl` + `MoneyInput` +
 * eager-after-error are the same three pieces `BookingPoliciesPanel` uses for the
 * deposit. A cancellation fee and a deposit are both "a number this company
 * charges", so a second visual language for one of them would read as a
 * different kind of setting.
