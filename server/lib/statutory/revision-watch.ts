/**
 * Noticing that an authority changed its form — and stopping there.
 *
 * ── Detection is automatic. Adoption is not, and cannot be made so here ─────
 * A watcher that only REPORTS costs nothing on the day it misses one: somebody
 * finds the new revision the ordinary way, later. A watcher that REPLACES costs
 * an inspector the wrong statutory form — filled in, signed, and filed with the
 * state — and it costs it silently, because both documents look official. The
 * asymmetry is the whole design: nothing in this file, and nothing that calls
 * it, writes to `statutory_form_versions`.
 *
 * ── Why a sighting cannot become a version by being copied ──────────────────
 * `RevisionSighting` carries five facts, and every one of them is something a
 * fetch can establish: which form we were looking for, the page we looked at,
 * the digest of the bytes it served, when we looked, and how that digest
 * compared to what we publish. It carries no `effectiveFrom`, no
 * `mandatoryFrom`, no `effectiveUntil` and no `publishedBy`, because those are
 * not observations — they are a person deciding that this revision applies from
 * this date and standing behind it. `form-registry.ts` refuses a version row
 * that lacks those marks, so the closest thing anybody could build out of a
 * sighting comes back from `versionForInspection` as nothing.
 *
 * ── And a detected revision is unusable even after somebody publishes it ────
 * The bytes are half of a form. The other half is a field map authored against
 * those exact bytes by a person who read the agency's PDF, and it may not be
 * inherited from the previous revision — `field-map.ts` says why at length. The
 * cost of a revision is redoing the layout, not fetching a file, which is the
 * second reason a downloader could never be an adopter.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately NOT here ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A surface. There is nowhere in this software that shows a person a sighting
 * yet; the operator console that would is a separate, unbuilt piece of work.
 * Until it exists the record is the `statutory_form_sightings` table and a
 * logged warning, and that gap is stated rather than papered over with a screen
 * built on a guess about where it belongs.
