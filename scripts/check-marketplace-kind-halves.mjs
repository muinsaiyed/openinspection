/**
 * Every marketplace catalogue kind needs BOTH halves: an import path and an
 * un-import path.
 *
 * ── The rule already existed; nothing executed it ───────────────────────────
 * `marketplace_libraries` says so in its own comment: "Adding a kind means
 * adding both halves; there is no generic fallthrough, because a silent one is
 * how the wrong table gets written." That is a rule written down and enforced by
 * nobody, which is a comment rather than an invariant.
 *
 * The two halves genuinely differ per kind — retiring one local `templates` row
 * is not the same operation as deleting N tagged `comments` rows — so a single
 * branch pretending they are the same is how one of the two gets it wrong. That
 * is why the check is per kind and per half, not "there is an uninstall
 * somewhere".
 *
 * It arrived RED on purpose: no un-import path existed anywhere in
 * `marketplace.service.ts`, so neither kind had its second half. It was not
 * describing a mistake made while writing it; it was reporting a gap that was
 * already there and that nothing else in the tree could see.
 *
 * Loosening the check to make it green sooner would blind it at exactly the
 * moment it matters: the next kind added is the one nobody has a mental model
 * for yet.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ A BRANCH THAT NOTHING CALLS IS NOT A HALF ────────────────────────────
 * The first version of this gate counted branches inside two service members and
 * stopped there, and it reported 6/6 GREEN over an `uninstall()` with no route,
 * no action and no button anywhere — while both locale files already shipped the
 * sentence an inspector reads when a template was retired BY an uninstall, a
 * state no workspace could reach. "Both halves exist" was true of the service
 * and false of the product.
 *
 * So each half is now also required to be CALLED from the API surface
 * (`server/api/`, `server/portal/`). That is the honest limit of what this
 * instrument can measure: it proves a request can reach the half, not that a
 * person can — a route with no button in `app/` still passes, and a route in a
 * file nobody mounts still passes. It closes the failure that actually happened
 * and it does not pretend to close more.
 *
 * ── Why the halves are scoped to their own function bodies ──────────────────
 * A file-wide search for `kind === 'comments'` is satisfied by ANY mention,
 * including the import branch itself — so a scan that looked at the whole file
 * would report both halves present the moment one was written. The halves are
 * therefore read from the two function bodies separately, and the parser that
 * does it is scored against fixtures on every ordinary run, because a parser
 * that stopped finding a body prints the same clean line as a repository that
 * is fine.
