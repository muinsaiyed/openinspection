// `comments` rows) share one table, one browse query and one import path.
//
// `kind` is the only thing that decides which local table an import writes and
// how an un-import undoes it. Adding a kind means adding both halves; there is
// no generic fallthrough, because a silent one is how the wrong table gets
// written. See #293.
