/**
 * `addPerson` must say whether it actually seated anyone (IA-133).
 *
 * The add is idempotent on purpose — `onConflictDoNothing` against the unique
 * (inspection, contact, role) index is what makes a double-submit or a retry
 * safe. The defect was never the DB behavior; it was that "changed nothing"
 * and "granted access" came back from the API as the same 200, so the People
 * modal closed on both.
 *
 * That is only a cosmetic bug until you read the notice the modal shows while
 * you do it: it told operators that re-adding someone reissues a revoked report
 * link. It cannot — report tokens are unique per (inspection, recipient), so
 * there is no second row to mint. Verified in the browser against seeded data:
 * re-adding an agent whose access was revoked closed the modal as success and
 * left `inspection_access_tokens.revoked_at` untouched. The operator believed
 * they had restored access to a report and had not.
 *
 * So the assertion that matters is not "adding twice is safe" — it always was.
 * It is that the second call is DISTINGUISHABLE from the first.
