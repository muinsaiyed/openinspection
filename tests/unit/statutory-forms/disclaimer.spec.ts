/**
 * The notice that travels with a rendered statutory form.
 *
 * It is an ALLOCATION statement, not a liability waiver, and the difference is
 * the closing sentence. Without it the notice drifts into "if we drew it wrong,
 * that is your problem", which is an ineffective risk-shift: it does not move
 * the risk, it only reads as though it did.
 *
 * WARNING ON APOSTROPHES. Every apostrophe in the notice and in this file is
 * U+2019 (a typographic apostrophe), never U+0027. They render almost
 * identically, so a mismatch fails `toContain` for a reason nobody can see --
 * and the next person fixes the TEST rather than the text.
