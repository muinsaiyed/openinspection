/**
 * session-context capabilities — the chrome's copy of the server's answer.
 *
 * The sidebar decides whether to offer Dispatch from this payload. If it
 * shipped the raw `permission_overrides` instead of the resolved set, every
 * consumer would have to re-apply the role defaults and the owner pinning, and
 * a second implementation of an authorization rule is a second place for it to
 * be wrong. So what travels is the answer `getCapabilities` gave.
 *
 * The two cases worth pinning are the ones a role check gets backwards: an
 * INSPECTOR granted `scheduleOthers` (may dispatch) and an owner, who cannot be
 * reduced by an override at all.
