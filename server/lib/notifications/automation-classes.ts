/**
 * Which notification class a SEEDED automation rule is.
 *
 * Every scheduled or automatic send in the product is an automation rule, so
 * without this the whole rules layer reaches the send boundary unnamed — and a
 * preference cannot apply to something that cannot be named.
 *
 * KEYED ON THE SEED, NOT THE TRIGGER. The trigger is the obvious key and it is
 * wrong: `report.published` alone carries five seeds, three of them to the same
 * client, and they do not agree on whether they may be switched off — spec §5.3
 * settles it as "report-ready is required and post-inspection follow-up /
 * review request are not". One trigger-keyed class could not hold both answers.
 *
 * The key is `trigger::name`, which is exactly the identity `ensureSeeds` diffs
 * on. A rule renamed by a tenant would already be re-seeded as a new rule by
 * that mechanism, so this is no more fragile than what it sits beside.
 *
 * TENANT-CREATED RULES RETURN `undefined`, and that is a decision. They have no
 * code-owned identity, so there is no class, so a recipient cannot mute them —
 * but the operator can disable any rule outright (§5.3), so the control exists;
 * it is the operator's. An invented per-rule class would put a tenant's data in
 * a vocabulary the send boundary fails closed on.
