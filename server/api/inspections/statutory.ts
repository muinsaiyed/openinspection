/**
 * Serve the statutory form an inspection's template declares.
 *
 * -- WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE ------------------------------------------------
 * Not `evidence.ts`: those three helpers key off an agreement envelope, and
 * this one keys off an inspection and a template declaration. Not
 * `report-delivery.ts`: that file is already past 700 lines against a 400-line
 * ceiling, so adding a fourth deliverable there buys a refactor nobody asked
 * for. The headers are shared instead of the file being shared --
 * `lib/deliverable-headers.ts`.
 *
 * -- TWO PRECONDITIONS, AND NEITHER IS COSMETIC ------------------------------
 * 1. The inspection must have a PUBLISHED report version. A statutory form
 *    produced from still-editable content is a document nobody can reproduce:
 *    re-requesting it after another edit yields different bytes with the same
 *    name. It also leaves `x-artifact-status` with no produced-at to be true
 *    about, and a status header that cannot be wrong is a header with no
 *    content in it.
 * 2. The template snapshot must declare a form. Absent is the ordinary case for
 *    almost every template, so this is a 404 -- there is no such document for
 *    this inspection -- rather than an error.
 * 3. The revision this template produces must be the revision this inspection's
 *    own date selects. A mismatch is the one state the design blocks, and it is
 *    blocked HERE rather than only in the editor's banner: producing anyway
 *    would put the governing revision's bytes under the superseded revision's
 *    bindings, and where two revisions' field names overlap that is a plausible,
 *    WRONG official document which `recordProduction` then files as legitimate.
 *    The judgement is `revisionStatusForInspection` -- the same call the banner,
 *    the reschedule response and the update confirmation make, because a warning
 *    and a refusal that each decided for themselves would disagree at some date
 *    boundary, and the disagreement would be silent.
 *
 * 4. The revision must not have been WITHDRAWN. Checked ahead of 3, because a
 *    withdrawal is the only fault here that has already put wrong documents in
 *    somebody's hands, and the refusal names WHY it was withdrawn: this
 *    software's field map was found wrong, in which case a correction is coming
 *    from us and what already went out should go out again, or the authority
 *    retired the document, in which case nothing is coming and the reader moves
 *    to the revision now in force. The two sentences live in
 *    `lib/statutory/withdrawal-copy.ts`, not here.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO migration out of that state (see revision-status.ts):
 * the way out is a new inspection on the updated template. Every OTHER refusal
 * on this path -- the producer's and the renderer's -- reaches the reader
 * through `refusalToUser`; see that file for why it had to be added.
 *
 * `producedAt` is the published version's own timestamp, never `Date.now()`.
 * Passing now would make the header read `current` forever, including for a
 * form whose report has since been corrected.
