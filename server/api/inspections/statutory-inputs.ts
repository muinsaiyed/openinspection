 * Everything a statutory render reads that is NOT the template's own answers.

 * template declares it, the workspace installed it. This decides WHAT goes on
 * it, and the two are read at different moments. The route reached its size
 * ceiling; splitting on that line was better than raising it, because these
 * four reads share one property worth naming in one place: each is the SAME
 * source the report PDF uses, so the two documents cannot disagree about the

 * each answer for a different part. Nothing in this product RECORDS who signed
 * for a section, so any other scope is refused by name rather than quietly
 * answered with the whole-form signer — which would put one person's mark under
