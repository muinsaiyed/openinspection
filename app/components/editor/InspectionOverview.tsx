/**
 * The "Inspection Details" overview — property facts, the statutory form
 * details panel, and the commercial-only controls beneath them.
 *
 * -- WHY IT IS A COMPONENT AND NOT JSX INSIDE THE ROUTE ----------------------
 * The route renders TWO separate trees, mobile and desktop, not one tree with a
 * breakpoint. This markup lived inline in the desktop tree only, so choosing
 * "Inspection Details" in the mobile Sections drawer set `activeView` to
 * "property" and the mobile `<main>` — which knows only about the item editor —
 * rendered NOTHING: no PROPERTY INFO heading and no statutory panel, at any
 * width. Measured at 390.
 *
 * The same shape of bug is recorded twice already in the route, on the photo
 * inputs and the add-media overlays, with the same fix: define it once and
 * mount it from both shells. Naming it also stops the two from drifting, which
 * hoisting it into a local would not have — a local is still 60 lines of markup
 * living in a 2,600-line file that is at its size cap.
 *
 * Every prop is derived by the route, and this component adds no state or
 * fetcher of its own, so it renders identically from either shell. Several of
 * its children DO own fetchers — they always did, each for a reason written
 * down where it lives — and this changes none of that: only ONE shell is
 * rendered at a time, so no child gained a second instance.
