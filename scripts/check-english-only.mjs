 * English-only gate for source (CLAUDE.md "Language Rules").
 *
 * OpenInspection is public. Its source, comments and user-facing strings are
 * read by people who do not read Chinese, and a CJK comment is a dead end for
 * every one of them. The rule was already written down; nothing enforced it, so
 * 11 files had drifted — mostly project shorthand that made perfect sense to
 * whoever typed it and none at all to a contributor.
 *
 * Scope note: this checks SOURCE. Translations under messages/<locale>/ are the
 * point of having translations, and the private superproject's docs are not
 * covered by this rule at all.
 *
 * Runs in `npm run lint` (CI's verify job) and deliberately NOT in pre-commit:
 * it walks the whole tree, and drifting language is not the kind of mistake
 * that needs catching within seconds of typing it. CI is soon enough.
