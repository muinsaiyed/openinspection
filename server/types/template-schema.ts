 * `improper_breaker_size`, `other_explain` -- and those were what the inspector
 * read on screen. The wording beside each box is PRINTED on the authority's
 * form, so putting it here is transcription, not invention.
 *
 * 🔴 THE VALUE IS THE VALUE. `render.ts` compares `value === whenValue` byte for
 * byte, so `label` is display only and must never be what gets stored. Storing
 * a label produces a completely blank official form and no gate goes red for it
 * -- that has already happened once, in `c6569cae`.

 * WHY NOT A PARALLEL `choiceLabels` MAP. Two lists that must agree, with nothing
 * making them agree, is the failure this project keeps hitting: one gets an
 * entry, the other does not, and the disagreement is invisible until an
 * inspector reads a raw key or a form prints blank. Pairing them makes drift

     * -- WHY A PARENT POINTER AND NOT AN INDENT LEVEL ---------------------
     * An indent level draws the same picture and answers none of the
     * questions that matter: delete the parent and its indented rows are
     * still level 2, dangling under nothing; move the parent and nothing
     * knows what should travel with it. A parent pointer answers both, and
     * makes "is this document well formed" a question with an answer.
     *
     * -- WHY NOT A `children` ARRAY ---------------------------------------
     * Dozens of places walk `section.items` as a flat array. Nesting the
     * array turns every one of them into a recursion, and the ones that are
     * missed do not throw -- they silently print less. A parent pointer keeps
     * the array one-dimensional, so every existing walk still sees every item.
     *
     * -- THE ARRAY ORDER IS THE TREE ORDER --------------------------------
     * `items` is a pre-order walk of the tree: an item's whole subtree sits
     * immediately after it and before its next sibling. That invariant is what
     * lets a report print A, A.1, A.1.a, A.2, B by reading the array in order,
     * with no renderer change at all. See `server/lib/template-hierarchy.ts`.
     *
     * Depth is capped at three levels -- the same bound, for the same
     * bounded-parent-walk reason, as the unit tree in `services/unit.service.ts`.
     * A parent in another section is not a parent: sections are the report's
     * pagination and table-of-contents unit.

 * A template's declaration that it produces an authority's own statutory form.

 * is a property of the WHOLE template, not of one row in it: which revision of
 * the form applies is chosen from the inspection's date, whether the required
 * values are all bound is a question about the template as a document, and the
 * declaration governs a rendering step that happens once per inspection rather
 * than once per item. An item type can express none of those — it can only say
 * "this one row behaves differently", which is the wrong grain and would leave
 * the version choice with no owner.
 *
 * IT NAMES A FORM, NEVER A REVISION. Which revision applies is decided by the
 * inspection date. A revision pinned here would go stale the moment the
 * authority republishes, and would put that choice in the hands of whoever last
 * edited the template instead of in the date the inspection actually happened.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS KEY IS PLATFORM-SUPPLIED AND NOT WRITABLE BY A WORKSPACE. The tenant

 * template carrying one cannot arrive through the tenant surface at all. That
 * closed door is the enforcement; this comment is only the reason for it.
