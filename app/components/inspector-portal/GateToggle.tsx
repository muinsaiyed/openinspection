/**
 * A per-inspection delivery gate: "the client can't open the report until this
 * has happened."
 *
 * The two gates (`agreementRequired`, `paymentRequired`) sat in a "Pricing &
 * gates" section of the report editor's settings sheet, where the only clue
 * they existed was a gear icon with no label. They do more than default the
 * publish dialog's checkboxes: `agreementRequired` decides whether
 * agreement-URL automations fire at all, and `paymentRequired` is what turns a
 * signing link into a sign-and-pay link. Each one belongs on the card for the
 * artifact it gates — the agreement gate with the agreements, the payment gate
 * with the invoice — because that is where somebody would look for it.
 *
 * It renders as a switch, not a button, and sits at the foot of the card BODY,
 * above the action row: it is a piece of this card's state, not one of the
 * card's actions. Saving is immediate; there is nothing to confirm and nothing
 * to lose by flipping it back.
