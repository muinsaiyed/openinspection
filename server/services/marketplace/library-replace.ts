/**
 * Deciding what a library "replace" would cost, before any of it happens (#348).
 *
 * Replace mode swaps the rows a previous import created for the current
 * release's. What makes that safe to offer is that a row the tenant rewrote can
 * now be told apart from one that arrived as-is — see
 * `server/lib/library-edit-marker.ts` for why that rests on a content hash
 * captured at import time rather than on an "edited" timestamp.
 *
 * These helpers are free functions rather than methods so the preview and the
 * update itself provably ask the same questions of the same data. A preview that
 * could disagree with the operation it previews is worse than none.
