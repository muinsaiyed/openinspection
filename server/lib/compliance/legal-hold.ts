/**
 * Active legal holds, read once per sweep.
 *
 * A GLOBAL INVARIANT: `legal_hold` overrides every scheduled
 * deletion rule. This module is the only place that decides what "active" means,
 * so no executor can disagree with the driver about whether a tenant is held.
 *
 * ── A failed read is NOT an empty result ────────────────────────────────────
 * `loadActiveHolds` throws rather than returning nothing when it cannot read the
 * table, and the sweep does not catch it. That asymmetry is the whole point: the
 * failure mode this guard exists to prevent is a sweep that could not see the
 * holds and therefore deleted everything under them, and an empty set is exactly
 * what an unreadable table looks like from the outside. A sweep that skips a
 * night is recoverable; a sweep that ran during a preservation order is not.
 *
 * ── Why the set is loaded once, not per rule ────────────────────────────────
 * Eighteen rules run in one tick. Re-reading per rule would let a hold placed
 * mid-sweep apply to some tables and not others, producing a tenant whose data
 * is half preserved — the worst outcome to have to explain. One read at the top
 * makes the whole tick consistent with a single instant.

/**
 * Whether something belonging to this tenant may be deleted right now.
 *
 * ── Why a function and not an `if` at each call site ────────────────────────
 * There are three deletion paths — the scheduled sweep, a subject erasure, and
 * a tenant purge — and the failure this exists to prevent is exactly that they
 * disagreed. They did: the sweep asked about holds and the erasure did not, so
 * a preservation order stopped one and not the other. One function they all ask
 * makes disagreement impossible rather than unlikely.
 *
 * ── This answers ONE of three questions, and must not be read as all three ──
 * Three separate things can be true of a workspace's data at once, and they are
 * arbitrated rather than ranked:
 *
 *   ordinary lifecycle — a retention window expired, so delete on schedule
 *   preservation order — a matter requires this data to stay
 *   subject erasure    — a person asked for their data to go
 *
 * This function answers only the middle one: does an order cover this tenant.
 * It deliberately does NOT decide what the asker should do about that, because
 * the right answer differs by asker. A sweep that is told `preserve` skips the
 * night and owes nobody an explanation. A subject erasure that is told
 * `preserve` still has to be admitted, recorded, and answered — refusing it at
 * the door is as wrong as ignoring the order, and folding the two askers into
 * one boolean here is how that distinction gets lost.
 *
 * ── Why it takes no scope ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A hold covers a tenant. `legal_holds` has no scope column, and its schema
 * header explains that as a decision: a narrow hold must enumerate coverage
 * before anyone knows what the matter will need, and every record it failed to
 * name is deleted on schedule while a hold is nominally in force. This is the
 * seam a narrower rule would land on if one is ever wanted — the signature
 * already takes the tenant rather than a boolean, so adding scope later widens
 * this function instead of rewriting its callers.
