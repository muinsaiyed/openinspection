/**
 * Markdown link gate — every relative link and image in a tracked .md file
 * must resolve to a file that exists.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-doc-links.mjs
 *
 * Why this exists: the docs restructure found fourteen broken links, and three
 * of them had been broken for months before that change — CONTRIBUTING.md
 * pointed at `docs/extending.md`, which has never existed in this repository.
 * Nothing was looking, so nothing complained. A reader who follows a dead link
 * in the deploy guide is a reader who gives up on self-hosting.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow:
 *   - relative paths only. External URLs are not fetched (a gate that needs
 *     the network is a gate that fails on a plane), and `#anchor`-only links
 *     are left alone.
