/**
 * `/settings/statutory-forms` — the screen that supplies an authority's own PDF.
 *
 * ── THE ASSERTION THIS FILE EXISTS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The server's refusal names the uploaded file's sha256, the one the revision
 * records, the fact that the revision is printed inside the document, and where
 * the authority publishes it. That paragraph IS the remedy, and a screen that
 * replaced it with "Upload failed" would still pass a test asserting "an error
 * is shown" — which is exactly the wrong-satisfier this page was built to
 * avoid. So the refusal is asserted VERBATIM, as one text node, and the
 * generic sentence is asserted ABSENT in the same breath.
 *
 * The other three are pairs for the same reason:
 *   - presence is read per row, and each row is checked NOT to wear the
 *     other's pill (a page that rendered one row twice passes any single-row
 *     assertion);
 *   - the result banner is checked to land on the row it belongs to AND to be
 *     absent from the other (one shared banner satisfies the first alone);
 *   - the "no storage bound" warning has a positive control and a negative
 *     one, because a banner that is always mounted looks identical to a
 *     correct one on the only screenshot anybody takes.
