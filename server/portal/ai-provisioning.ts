/**
 * GET /api/platform/ai-provisioning — AI provisioning status for portal's
 * tier-quota console (managed-ai Task 5 follow-up (a)).
 *
 * Per tier, how many tenants would resolve to managed / BYO / unconfigured
 * credentials RIGHT NOW. The bucketing is `resolveRuntimeAiSource` — the same
 * `resolveAi` call, with the same still-false entitlement literal, that tags
 * the usage meter — so this endpoint cannot drift from what the runtime would
 * actually do (portal deliberately stores nothing and asks on every read).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE NUMBERS HERE MOVE WHEN OI CHANGES, WITH NO PORTAL DEPLOY. Entitlement
 * is derived from the tenant's plan inside `resolveRuntimeAiSource`; anything
 * that changes that answer repaints an operator console in another repository
 * in the same commit. That is the price of having one resolver, and it is the
 * right price — the alternative is a portal-side copy that can be wrong.
 *
 * Wire contract (pinned by portal's `narrowAiProvisioning`): a tier with no
 * tenants is ABSENT from `tiers`, never a zeroed row — portal renders absent
 * as "core did not mention it". All three counts are finite numbers. The
 * managed bucket is 0 everywhere until entitlement ships; that is the truth,
 * not a gap.
 *
 * Cost note: one secrets read (KV-cached ciphertext + decrypt) per tenant per
 * request. This is a console read, not a hot path; revisit only if tenant
 * count makes it one.
