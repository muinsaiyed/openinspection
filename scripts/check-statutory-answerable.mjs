/**
 * Can every answer this software accepts actually appear on the form?
 *
 * ── The rule ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * What an inspector enters must correspond to something on the authority's
 * page. The one exception is the inspection's own basic attributes -- property
 * address, inspector name, licence number, dates -- which are properties of the
 * inspection rather than answers to the form's questions, and which the form
 * asks for in its header wherever it asks at all.
 *
 * ── What this gate actually checks, which is narrower ───────────────────────
 * The general rule is not decidable from a field map: "is this the right box"
 * needs a person, which is what `checkedBy` is. What IS decidable is the case
 * where the software offers an answer that the page has NOWHERE TO RECORD:
 *
 *   an "Other" option with no blank beside it and no comments box to explain in.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-29 on the Citizens four-point form: `electrical.wiring_types`
 * offers `other`, the page prints a bare "Other" with nothing after it, and that
 * section has no comments block. An inspector who picks it sends an insurer a
 * lone X. The insurer learns that the wiring is something -- and not what.
 *
 * ── Why "Other (explain)" is NOT a finding ─────────────────────────────────
 * Several forms print "Other (explain)" and mean the explanation goes in the
 * section's own comments block, which the same page carries. That is a
 * destination, so it passes: the group's `overflowTo` or a sibling description
 * overlay both count. The gate is looking for answers with NO destination at
 * all, not for answers whose destination is somewhere else on the page.
 *
 * ── And where the page genuinely has none ──────────────────────────────────
 * Three options across the four published forms are unanswerable on the
 * authority's own page, and no field map can invent a blank the publisher did
 * not print. They are listed one by one in `ACKNOWLEDGED` below, each with the
 * measured evidence and with where a person actually writes the explanation,
 * and each is PRINTED IN FULL on every run beside the counts. That is the
 * difference between recording a finding and deleting one. An option not on the
 * list still fails, and an entry that stops matching anything fails too --
 * a forgiveness that outlives the thing it forgave is a widened gate nobody
 * decided to widen.
 *
 * ── What it cannot do ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⚠️ It reads the published catalogue, and a catalogue with no `other` options
 * examines nothing. It PRINTS the number rather than a tick, because a gate
 * that examined nothing and a clean result look identical from outside, and
 * this repository has fixed four gates that failed exactly that way.
