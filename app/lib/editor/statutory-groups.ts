/**
 * What the editor needs to know about a template's statutory groups.
 *
 * -- THE PRINTED SLOTS NEED NO NEW STORAGE ------------------------------------
 * A binding key already carries the whole answer: `electrical_panel[0]
 * .total_amps` names the group, the slot and the field, and the binding points
 * at the template item holding it. So "which items make up Main Panel" is a
 * question the declaration can already answer, and this module only reads it
 * back out. Nothing about a printed slot is stored twice.
 *
 * -- WHY THE EDITOR HAS TO KNOW AT ALL ---------------------------------------
 * Without this the group is invisible: the items render as a flat run
 * distinguished only by a label prefix, and the two most natural gestures for
 * adding a third panel -- "Add item" and "Duplicate" -- both mint a NEW item id.
 * A binding points at a specific id, so the value an inspector then types
 * reaches no form at all, and nothing tells him. That silent drop is the failure
 * this whole subsystem exists to prevent, arriving through the friendliest
 * button on the screen.
 *
 * -- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE -------------------------------------------
 * Instances past `capacity`. They have no template item, because the authority's
 * page has no slot to print them in; they live per-inspection and are routed
 * into the form's own comments box. This module describes what the form prints.
