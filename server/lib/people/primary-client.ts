/**
 * The one rule about who may leave an inspection (IA-36 ⑫⑬).

 * "Primary client" is expressed by the role KEY (`client`), not a boolean
 * column, so there is exactly one source of truth and nothing to keep in sync.
 * The seat MOVES (PeopleService.makePrimary) rather than being defended by
 * refusing to add a second one.
 *
 * The one thing that genuinely cannot happen is an inspection with nobody on
 * the client side — a report with no recipient. That is a rule, so it is stated
 * here once and read by both the API that enforces it and the card that
 * explains it. Hiding the button instead would leave the operator guessing,
 * which is the pattern this audit item exists to remove.
