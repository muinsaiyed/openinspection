/**
 * Cancelling a booking whose only money is a HELD DEPOSIT.
 *
 * This is the seam between the cancellation ladder and the deposit, and it is
 * the case the deposit feature exists for: a client no-shows on a job that was
 * never invoiced. Two things have to be true, and they fail in opposite
 * directions:
 *
 *  1. The deposit COUNTS as collected. `resolveCancellation` caps every fee at
 *     `paidCents`, so quoting zero would make a 100% no-show fee charge nothing
 *     and refund nothing — the deposit sits held forever and the feature is
 *     inert exactly where it was supposed to bite.
 *  2. The refund it calls for actually gets WRITTEN. Counting the deposit while
 *     `applyCancellationRefund` still needs an invoice would be worse than
 *     today: the quote would promise a refund and the write would silently do
 *     nothing. `refundHeldDeposit` is the second writer, and these tests are
 *     what stop the pair from shipping half-done.
 *
 * The mixed case — a webhook landing after the invoice was raised, so both
 * pools hold money — drains the INVOICE first. Its `amount_paid_cents` is a
 * number a human reads off a screen, and leaving it overstated while the money
 * came back out of an invisible pool is the same "cash in one place and not the
 * other" failure in miniature.
