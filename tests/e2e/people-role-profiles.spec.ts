/**
 * People / Role Profiles E2E (Plan 1B Task 8).
 *
 * Covers steps 1-4 of the plan brief. Step 5 ("`/settings/automations`
 * recipient dropdown lists the new custom role") is OUT OF SCOPE on this
 * branch: it depends on Plan 1B Task 6 (recipient picker -> role profiles),
 * which was deferred to Spec 2 because the backing `recipient_kind` /
 * `recipient_role_profile_id` columns don't exist yet. The automations
 * recipient dropdown is still the fixed client/buying_agent/selling_agent/
 * inspector/all list.
 *
 *   1. Admin login -> /contacts -> the admin-only "Roles" tab is visible.
 *   2. Create a custom `kind=other` role profile "Buyer's Attorney" -> it
 *      appears in the Roles list.
 *   3. Open an inspection detail -> People section -> "Add person" ->
 *      search/select an existing contact -> assign "Buyer's Attorney" -> the
 *      row appears grouped under "Other".
 *   4. Attempt to add a SECOND person under the "Client" role -> blocked with
 *      the primary-client 409 conflict message surfaced in the modal. (The
 *      editor-seed fixture inspection already carries its creation-time
 *      client — "Editor Seed Client" — as the primary `client`-kind person,
 *      confirmed by the DOM at /inspections/:id before this step runs; so
 *      adding any OTHER contact under "Client" is already the second one.)
 *
 * Fixtures: depends on the `editor-seed` Playwright project (see
 * playwright.config.ts) for the shared admin (admin@autotest.com) and a real
 * inspection id (editor-seed's own POST /api/inspections call already seeds
 * that inspection's primary client into inspection_people). The `api`
 * project's POST /api/auth/setup separately seeds the 8 default role
 * profiles (server/lib/people/default-role-profiles.ts) via
 * seedStarterContent -> seedRoleProfiles. `beforeAll` creates two contacts via
 * the API (search fixtures for the Other-role add and the blocked Client-role
 * add below); the modal's "create new contact inline" path is deliberately
 * NOT exercised here — see the code comment above `SEARCH_*` for why.
 *
 * Run: npm run test:e2e -- people-role-profiles
