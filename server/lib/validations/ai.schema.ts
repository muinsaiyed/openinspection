/**
 * WHY EVERY AI RESPONSE BELOW CARRIES `aiCallId`.
 *
 * It is the `ai_call_provenance.id` of the call that produced the text, and the
 * only thing an `ai_content_reviews` row can cite. Until the chokepoint returned
 * it, the ledger recorded every call and no response could say which row was
 * its own — so a review of this output had nothing to point at, and the AI call
 * and its acceptance stayed two events with nothing linking them.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS NOT `model` AND `promptVersion`, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN. Both are
 * already on the provenance row. Shipping them here would put deployment
 * configuration in a client payload and create a second pair of values that has
 * to agree with the first; they are read through this id instead.
 *
 * NULLABLE WHERE A NON-AI ARM EXISTS, required where none does. Three arms
 * return prose no model wrote — the standalone dev mocks, the "no defects
 * observed" literal, and the empty suggestion list a runtime failure degrades to
 * — and an id on any of those would be evidence of a review of model output
 * that was never generated. `null` means "there is nothing here to review". The
 * comment-assist path has no such arm, so its id is always a real row.
