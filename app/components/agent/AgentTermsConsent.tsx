/**
 * The agent terms, shown — not referred to.
 *
 * This exists as its own component because the signup page crossed the file-size
 * gate, and this was the block worth lifting: it is the whole presentation half of
 * one legal requirement, and it has a rule of its own that a reader should find in
 * one place rather than inline among form fields.
 *
 * ── The rule ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The tick says "I have read and accept the Agent Terms" and the account records
 * the version and content hash of the text shown. For a while the page displayed
 * nothing and linked nowhere, so the acceptance asserted a presentation that had
 * never happened — the same defect closed for e-signature,
 * where intent must come from a recorded act rather than be inferred from an
 * artefact existing. So the body is rendered in full, in the page, above the tick.
 *
 * Scrollable rather than truncated, and deliberately not a "read more" link: the
 * acceptance names the hash of the WHOLE body, so an excerpt would make the record
 * describe something the signer was never given.

 * Why signup cannot proceed — hoisted ABOVE the form by the page.
 *
 * This used to render in the tick's own place, between the password field and the
 * `Create account` button, while all three inputs and the button stayed fully
 * enabled. Somebody filling the form top-to-bottom therefore read "an account
 * cannot be created" only AFTER choosing a password, and then pressed a primary
 * button that could not succeed. Position and disabled-state are the whole fix:
 * the page renders this first and disables the form behind it.
 *
 * The copy it carries is a DEPLOYMENT-level fact. Three screens describe this one
 * state; this was the only one that called it a workspace and sent the reader to
 * the inspecting company's administrator. `deployment_legal_versions` is not
 * per-tenant and `scripts/publish-agent-terms.mjs` is its only writer, so no
 * tenant admin can resolve it however they configure their company — the page
 * that said otherwise sent a real reader round a loop that had no exit.
