/**
 * Why the two real module graphs above are STATIC imports (#88/#95).
 *
 * They used to sit inside `it()` bodies under an explicit `20000` timeout, with
 * a comment saying the graph is heavy and can exceed the 5 s default. The
 * comment was right and the mitigation was not. `~/components/Sidebar` reaches
 * `~/paraglide/messages`, whose generated `_index.js` is ~3.67 MB and which
 * ~441 source files import; Vite transforms it once, on the single main thread
 * every vitest worker shares. So the wait is QUEUEING, and it scales with how
 * busy the suite is rather than with the machine:
 *
 *   solo   (`vitest run app/components/sidebar.test.ts`)      2472 ms
 *   loaded (`vitest run app/components --maxWorkers=16`)     19206 ms
 *
 * A 7.8x swing against a 20000 ms ceiling — 794 ms of headroom, on a laptop, on
 * a suite that is still growing, on a runner that is not CI. A raised timeout
 * never removed the cost; it moved the cliff. It also only ever protected the
 * payer: every other worker queued behind the same transform regardless.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE `beforeAll` HOIST IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS PARTICULAR GRAPH, and that is
 * worth knowing before reaching for it elsewhere. `beforeAll`'s budget is
 * separate from `testTimeout` but it is not absent: it is `hookTimeout`, which
 * defaults to 10000 ms. Hoisting these two imports into a `beforeAll` was tried
 * and failed under the same loaded run — "Hook timed out in 10000ms" — because
 * 19 s does not fit in a 10 s budget any more than in a 5 s one. Hoisting
 * relocates a cost; only a static import stops it being ANYONE's deadline,
 * because it is paid during COLLECTION, which has no timeout at all.
 *
 * So the order of preference is: static import; then `beforeAll` when a
 * `vi.doMock` must be installed before the module resolves (which is why the
 * repair-builder specs are dynamic and this one is not); and never a raised
 * timeout of either kind. Nothing here mocks anything, so nothing here has to
 * be dynamic. Placement is enforced by `npm run lint:test-imports`.
