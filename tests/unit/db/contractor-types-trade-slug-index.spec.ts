/**
 * The partial unique index on `contractor_types (tenant_id, trade_slug)`.
 *
 * WHY A BEHAVIOURAL TEST AND NOT A SCHEMA ASSERTION. An index whose predicate
 * is wrong is completely silent. Drop the `WHERE trade_slug IS NOT NULL` and
 * the migration still applies, `db:check` still passes (schema and migrations
 * agree — they are both wrong together), every existing spec still goes green,
 * and the damage only appears the first time a workspace adds a second
 * custom contractor type and the insert is rejected for no reason a user could
 * understand. Nothing in the gate ladder can see that. Only exercising the
 * three cases can.
 *
 * Each case is a different way to get this index wrong:
 *   - the predicate is read back  → catches dropping WHERE / narrowing it
 *   - two NULLs allowed           → catches making the column NOT NULL, or
 *                                   sentinel-slugging un-mapped types
 *   - duplicate slug refused      → catches dropping UNIQUE, or the whole index
 *   - same slug, other tenant OK  → catches indexing `trade_slug` alone
 *
 * ⚠️ ONE THING THIS CANNOT BE STRUCTURED AS. The obvious design — "insert two
 * NULLs, that proves the WHERE clause is there" — is a false green, and it was
 * written that way first. **SQLite already treats NULLs as distinct in a unique
 * index**, so deleting `WHERE trade_slug IS NOT NULL` leaves all four
 * behaviours identical; the whole file stays green against an index that no
 * longer says what it means. The predicate is about keeping un-mapped rows out
 * of the index (and saying so), not about NULL semantics — so the only way to
 * pin it is to read it back out of `sqlite_master`, which is what the first
 * test does.
 *
 * The constraint exists because seeding dedupes by slug in APPLICATION code,
 * against a snapshot read. `starter-content.service.ts` says so in its own
 * comment. A backfill that stamps a slug onto a legacy row for a trade the
 * workspace already has must fail loudly rather than leave two rows for one
 * trade, with `defectTrade -> contractorType` resolving to whichever the query
 * returned first.
 *
 * ── THIS FILE IS NOW THE ONLY GUARD ON THIS TABLE, ON PURPOSE ───────────────
 * A sibling spec used to exercise the one-time backfill that completed
 * `trade_slug` for workspaces predating the column. It read its subject out of
 * `migrations/` by filename, and the 2026-09-09 baseline rebuild folded that
 * file away, so the spec failed with "expected exactly one …, found 0".
 *
 * It was deleted rather than repointed at git history. What it tested was a
 * completion that runs ONCE, against workspaces that already existed when it
 * shipped; it has run everywhere it ever will, and a fresh install never needs
 * it — the canonical set arrives from `CONTRACTOR_TYPES` at workspace
 * creation, which is exactly what that migration's own comment said.
 *
 * What did NOT go away is the invariant, which is why it is worth saying here:
 * the live rule is this index plus the application-level dedupe above, and both
 * are exercised below against the current schema rather than against any file
 * in `migrations/`. Do not restore the deleted spec; extend this one.
