/**
 * Which ZIPs an inspector will travel to.
 *
 * Absence is the meaningful state: an inspector with ZERO rows serves
 * everywhere, mirroring `service_inspectors` (zero rows for a service = every
 * inspector qualifies). That default is what keeps this feature opt-in — a
 * workspace that never opens the panel behaves exactly as it did before.
 *
 * `zip_prefix` is stored as typed, uppercased and trimmed. v1 matches a
 * property ZIP by PREFIX, so '787' covers all of 787xx and '78701' covers only
 * itself; the comparison lives in `server/lib/booking/eligibility.ts` and is
 * the only place that knows the rule.
 *
 * No FKs per Schema Rules — `user_id` is an app-layer reference to `users.id`,
 * and the API deletes rows by (tenant, user) rather than relying on cascade.
