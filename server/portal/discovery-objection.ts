/**
 * The objection to being discoverable across tenants, and the proof it requires.
 *
 * `GET /api/platform/tenants/by-email` answers, for one address, which
 * inspection companies hold a live report grant for that person. It stays —
 * it is how a homebuyer who lost the email reaches their own report — but a
 * person has to be able to leave it.
 *
 * ── Why filing needs a grant token, and not just an address ──────────────────
 * The lookup is reachable from an anonymous form. An objection endpoint that
 * accepted a bare address would therefore be a DENIAL-OF-ACCESS TOOL aimed at
 * somebody else: type a stranger's address, and they can no longer find their
 * own report. So the caller must present an unrevoked
 * `inspection_access_tokens` secret whose recipient IS that address.
 *
 * That standard opens no new hole, which is the test it has to pass: the token
 * was mailed to the address and already releases the report itself, so the
 * objection path hands its user no capability they did not hold. The set of
 * people this endpoint can reveal anything about is exactly the set who were
 * sent grant mail.
 *
 * EXPIRY is accepted; REVOCATION is not. An expired link says only that it is
 * old, and holders of old links are precisely the population that wants this;
 * a revoked one is the tenant saying the secret is no longer trusted.
 * Withdrawal needs the same proof as filing, or it becomes a way to put someone
 * back into a lookup they left.
 *
 * A suppressed lookup returns a byte-identical response to an unknown address,
 * so consulting the table cannot out an objector, and no log line carries the
 * address or its hash.
 *
 * ── Split out of integration.routes.ts ──────────────────────────────────────
 * That file crossed its size ceiling, and this is the seam it already used for
 * `destruction-records.ts` and `ai-provisioning.ts`: a handler family with its
 * own reasoning lives beside the router rather than inside it.

 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. An objection path over an unauthenticated existence
 * oracle is itself an oracle. "Stop looking me up" that anybody may call for
 * anybody's address is a way to take away a stranger's route to their own
 * report, and a 200/403 split on a bare address would additionally answer the
 * very question the objection exists to stop answering.
 *
 * THE STANDARD. The caller must present an unrevoked `inspection_access_tokens`
 * secret whose recipient IS that address. That token was mailed to the address,
 * and it already releases the report itself — so this path hands its user no
 * capability they did not already hold, and someone who cannot produce it learns
 * nothing from being refused (they had to know the token to get past this, and
 * knowing the token means they were told the address).
 *
 * EXPIRY IS ACCEPTED, REVOCATION IS NOT. Expiry is link hygiene: it says the URL
 * is old, not that the holder is untrusted, and the people most likely to want
 * this are exactly those whose links have aged out. Revocation is the tenant
 * saying "this secret is no longer trusted" — honouring it here would let a
 * withdrawn token act on the person it was withdrawn from.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, recorded rather than papered over: a person who never
 * kept any grant email has no way to prove control, and this repository has no
 * authenticated end-user surface to give them one. They remain discoverable and
 * must ask a human. Closing it needs a verified-email challenge (or a portal
 * account) that does not exist yet — not a weaker check here.
