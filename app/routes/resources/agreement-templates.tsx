/**
 * BFF resource route for agreement TEMPLATE authoring (#67).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The template CRUD shipped complete on the
 * server — `POST /agreements`, `PUT /agreements/{id}`, `DELETE /agreements/{id}`,
 * each `requireRole('owner','manager')`, each sanitising the body through
 * `sanitizeAgreementHtml()` — and a grep of `app/` for any of the three came
 * back empty. The Library page listed templates and offered a "+ New agreement"
 * button carrying no handler, beside per-row "Edit" buttons carrying no handler.
 * A workspace could read the agreement it was seeded with and could not change
 * a word of it. This route is the front door.
 *
 * A client `fetch('/api/...')` arrives UNAUTHENTICATED in this repository — the
 * JWT is a server-held cookie — so the browser talks to this route and this
 * route relays the token to the in-process API.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SERVER IS THE SANITISING BOUNDARY, AND THIS ROUTE DOES NOT DUPLICATE
 * IT. `agreementService.createAgreement/updateAgreement` run every body through
 * `sanitizeAgreementHtml()` before it reaches D1. The editor converges its own
 * output onto a subset of that allow-list first (`app/lib/agreement-markup.ts`)
 * so the author is not shown a document the boundary will edit — but this route
 * forwards what it is given, unaltered. A second, differently-written cleanup
 * in the middle would be a third opinion about what an agreement may contain,
 * and the one that matters would no longer be the one that runs last.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES REFUSE is an EMPTY body. `content` is `.min(1)` in the API's Zod
 * schema, so an empty create is a 400 the UI can only render as a generic
 * failure; and on the PUT path an empty string is worse than a 400, because
 * `AgreementSchema.partial()` treats "" as a value the caller meant — the
 * service sanitises it to "" and stores it, silently blanking a live agreement.
 * Emptiness is decided on the TEXT, not the markup: `<p><br></p>` is what a
 * cleared contenteditable serialises to and contains no agreement at all.

/**

 *
 * Read-only. Fetches ONE template's body for the editor.
 *
 * There is no GET-one endpoint on the server — the admin router exposes list,
 * create, update and delete and nothing else — so this selects from the
 * tenant-scoped list rather than pretending an endpoint exists. The list is
 * already filtered by `tenantId` server-side, so an id belonging to another
 * workspace simply is not in it and falls through to the refusal below.
 *
 * #83 — IT ALSO READS THE CANCELLATION-CLAUSE ATTESTATION, because saving this
 * template may revoke it. `updateAgreement` increments `agreements.version` on
 * every write (identical content included — it compares nothing), and
 * `getCancellationAttestation()` returns null as soon as the attested version
 * stops matching. So one edit turns fee-charging off, and until the editor
 * existed nothing in the product could bump that version.
 *
 * ⚠️ `cancellationClause.current` is computed SERVER-SIDE by the same function
 * the fee gate reads, and is used here as-is. Recomputing it from the raw
 * columns plus the template's version would be a second copy of the
 * invalidation rule; the copy behind the warning would eventually disagree with
 * the copy behind the refusal.
