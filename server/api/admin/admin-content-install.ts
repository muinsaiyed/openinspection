/**
 * Install the starter content this release ships that this workspace does not
 * already have.
 *
 * Calls the SAME canonical seeder both provisioning paths use — SaaS via
 * `server/portal/apply-commands.ts`, standalone via `/setup`
 * (`server/api/auth.ts`). There is no second implementation and there must
 * never be one.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The seeder was anchored to `/setup`, which refuses forever
 * once a tenant user exists, so content only ever arrived on day one. An upgrade
 * carries schema (`db:migrate:remote` is in the deploy chain) and code, and
 * carried no content at all. This is the missing third thing.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. The skip check is by NAME, so this ADDS what is new and
 * never refreshes what exists — and a renamed row does not match, so it comes
 * back as a second copy. The UI copy says "install what's new" for that reason;
 * do not retitle it "sync".
 *
 * Deliberately NOT gated on deployment mode: both modes need it, and both
 * already call this seeder with this signature. Deliberately NOT mounted under
 * `/api/platform/*` either — that prefix 404s outside SaaS, which would
 * reproduce the exact gap this route closes.
