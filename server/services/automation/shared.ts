/**
 * Shared base + module-level helpers for the AutomationService mixin chain.
 *
 * The former monolithic `automation.service.ts` (~744 LOC) is split into focused
 * mixins (core / trigger / conditions / delivery / sms / reminders / logs). Each
 * mixin extends the previous one so EVERY method stays on a single `this`, and
 * the original method bodies move byte-identically (no delegation rewrites). The
 * only visibility change is `private` → `protected` so a method in one mixin can
 * read the deps / call the helpers another mixin defined — this is a TypeScript-
 * only widening with zero runtime effect, and the public surface is unchanged.
 *
 * The composed class is exported as `AutomationService` from
 * `../automation.service.ts`, so all call sites / tests / the cron caller keep
 * importing it from the same module.
