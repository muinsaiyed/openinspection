/**
 * Authentication above is NOT authorization, and this router needs both.
 *
 * Every route here administers a COMPANY-level finance integration.
 * `/disconnect` in particular revokes the Intuit refresh token and deletes the
 * tenant's whole `qbo_entity_map` — the OI-invoice -> QBO-invoice
 * correspondence table — which reconnecting does not restore, so the next push
 * writes duplicate invoices against the same DocNumbers. Until this line
 * existed, any signed-in inspector could do that, while listing a Stripe
 * webhook log next door (`integrations.ts`) already required owner/manager.
 *
 * Applied router-wide rather than per route: a uniform surface has no per-route
 * reasoning for a future edit to get wrong, and the read (`/status`) exposes the
 * connected realm, company name and sync errors, which is company books state.
 *
 * `requireRole` also refuses a caller with no role, which is what an agent
 * (client/realtor) JWT is — it satisfies the verifier above and deliberately
 * carries no tenant, so it must never reach a handler.
 *
 * The browser-facing half of the integration — `/connect` and `/callback` — is
 * NOT here: it lives in `api/qbo-oauth.ts`. Both routers share the
 * `/api/integrations/qbo` mount, so the two `use('*')` guards above re-register
 * across that whole prefix; `server/index.ts` mounts this router AFTER the pair
 * so they cannot answer Intuit's cookie-less `/callback`. `/connect` carries the
 * same owner/manager guard per route; `/callback` is authorized by `state`.
 *
 * Asserted at the HTTP boundary in `tests/unit/qbo/qbo-route-authorization.spec.ts`
 * (and `qbo-oauth-callback.spec.ts` for the pair that moved), because neither
 * authorization gate can see a hand-rolled Hono router.
