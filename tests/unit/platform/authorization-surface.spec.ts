/**
 * Task 12 (two-layer role model), closes IA-98 — declaration versus enforcement
 * over every capability-guarded route.
 *
 * require-capability.spec.ts proves the MIDDLEWARE decides correctly against a
 * synthetic app; it can never prove a real route wears it — a route missing its
 * guard still returns 200, just with more in it. Enumerating "which routes must
 * wear `financial`" per capability does not scale; inverting it does: every
 * route that DECLARES a capability (x-capability metadata) must MOUNT
 * requireCapability for it, and every route that mounts the guard must declare
 * it. The declared side is greppable documentation; this gate keeps the two
 * from drifting.
 *
 * Two sources, matched by method+path:
 * - DECLARED: the generated OpenAPI document (same walk as
 *   route-metadata.spec.ts) — x-capability survives as a vendor extension.
 *   The registry's route defs do NOT carry `middleware` (zod-openapi keeps
 *   only OpenAPI-relevant keys), which is why the doc alone cannot answer
 *   the enforcement side.
 * - MOUNTED: Hono's own routing table (app.routes), where every middleware is
 *   its own entry and requireCapability stamps `capability` on its closure.
