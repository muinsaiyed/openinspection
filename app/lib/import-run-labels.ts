/**
 * What an import run is called, and what its state is called.
 *
 * One module because TWO screens name the same run: the list says which run a
 * row is, and the run's own page says which run you have open. Two copies of
 * these tables is how one run comes to be called "Team members" in the list and
 * something else on its own page — and, worse, how a state added to the
 * lifecycle gets a label in one place and silently falls through to a default
 * in the other.
 *
 * Unlike `import-entry-points.ts` and `import-wizard-steps.ts` next door, this
 * module DOES read the message catalogue. Those two hold rules, which are
 * asserted without a DOM and therefore take their sentences from the caller;
 * this one holds nothing but names, and a caller-supplied name would just be
 * these tables moved back into both screens.
 *
 * Every lookup FALLS BACK rather than throwing. A run created before an intent
 * or a state existed still has to render — a page that throws on an unknown
 * string turns a stale row into a blank screen.

/**
 * The chip's colour per state. `monitor` is the one that means "this is waiting
 * for you"; `defect` means something the operator handed over did not come
 * through.
 *
 * `declined` takes `defect` rather than joining the settled states below, and
 * the line between them is who stopped and whether anything is left to do.
 * `abandoned` and `expired` are outcomes nobody needs told about — the operator
 * walked away, or a clock ran out. `declined` is a refusal by this deployment
 * on a file its owner is still waiting on: none of it landed, and they have to
 * do something else with it. That is the same news `partially_applied` carries,
 * more of it, so it is not the state to paint quieter than the partial ones.
 *
 * These are Pill's tone names, which are NOT the DS token names — Pill maps
 * `sat`→ok, `monitor`→watch, `defect`→bad internally. A tone spelled with the
 * token name instead compiles to an undefined key and paints nothing.
 *
 * The four settled states share `info` rather than taking Pill's muted greys,
 * for a measured reason: `gen` / `ni` / `neutral` are all
 * `bg-ih-bg-muted text-ih-fg-3`, which composites to 4.34:1 on a card at the
 * chip's 11px — under AA, and invisible to `lint:contrast`, which reads the
 * stylesheet and never composites the chip over the surface beneath it. The
 * distinction between "Undone", "Abandoned" and "Expired" is carried by the
 * word, which is the part that actually says what happened.
