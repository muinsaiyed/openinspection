/**
 * Wraps a better-sqlite3 instance in a minimal D1Database-shaped adapter,

 * directly (raw D1 API) rather than through Drizzle. Only `prepare/bind/run`
 * are implemented — enough to cover D1's `?1`/`?2`/... numbered-parameter
 * SQL and the `res.meta.changes` result shape.
 *
 * better-sqlite3 binds numbered params (`?NNN`) via an object keyed by the
 * parameter index as a string, not by positional array — this adapter does
 * that translation so the same SQL text runs unmodified against D1 in
 * production and against better-sqlite3 in unit tests.
 *
 * Both placeholder styles are supported because the codebase uses both, and
 * they need OPPOSITE binding forms in better-sqlite3: numbered `?N` takes the
 * index-keyed object, anonymous `?` takes positional arguments and throws
 * "Too few parameter values were provided" if handed the object. Supporting
 * only the numbered form made this helper silently unusable for every
 * anonymous-placeholder call site (e.g. the chunked bulk INSERT in
 * MarketplaceService), which is why one spec had grown its own private copy.
