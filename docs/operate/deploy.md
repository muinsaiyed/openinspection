# Deploying OpenInspection

This guide covers self-hosted production deploys — what every adopter does to run the engine for their own inspection business.

---

## Architecture overview

OpenInspection deploys as a single Cloudflare Worker (the cloudflare/react-router-hono-fullstack-template shape):

- **`workers/app.ts`** — a Hono entry that mounts the full API (`server/`, Hono + Drizzle + D1) in-process for API-owned paths and delegates all other (page) routes to React Router v8 SSR (`app/`, React 19 + Tailwind v4).
- React Router loaders/actions call the API DIRECTLY through an injected in-process `API_WORKER` self-binding — no network hop, no second worker, no Service Binding between workers.

One deployable; `npm run deploy` builds and ships it.

---

## Self-hosted production deploy

The recommended path is the one-click button in the README:

```
[Deploy to Cloudflare] → fork → run `npm run setup:cloudflare`
```

For the manual flow, see the **Quick start** section in the [README](../../README.md).

> **Already deployed?** To move an existing deployment to a newer release, see [`upgrade.md`](upgrade.md) — it covers backups, applying new migrations, and verifying the deployed version.

### Required Cloudflare resources

| Resource         | Binding         | Purpose                                                    |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Worker           | (one worker)    | Single Worker (API in-process + React Router SSR).        |
| D1 database      | `DB`            | All structured data (inspections, users, comments, ...).   |
| R2 bucket        | `PHOTOS`        | All object storage — field-form photos, pre-rendered report/certificate PDFs, and e-sign evidence packs. |
| KV namespace     | `TENANT_CACHE`  | Branding + tenant-config 1-hour cache.                     |
| Browser binding  | `BROWSER`       | PDF rendering for reports + e-sign certificates.           |
| Images binding   | `IMAGES` (optional) | Downscales Appendix B photos before embedding them in Word (.docx) exports. |
| Workflow         | `SIGN_COMPLETION_WORKFLOW` | Async e-sign pipeline (Spec 5H).                           |
| Durable Objects  | `INSPECTION_PRESENCE`, `TENANT_PRESENCE` | Live presence for the editor.               |
| Durable Object   | `INSPECTION_DOC` | The collaborative results document (Yjs CRDT). Absent → the editor's collab routes return `501` and collaborative editing does not engage. |
| Durable Object   | `INSPECTOR_MCP`  | The remote MCP server. Only reached when `MCP_ENABLED` is set. |
| KV namespace     | `OAUTH_KV`       | MCP OAuth grants. The binding NAME is fixed by `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`. |
| Queue            | `CRON_QUEUE`     | **Background jobs run on this queue, one job per invocation.** With it unbound the tick logs `CRON_QUEUE is not bound — no job will run` and every sweep, reminder and retention job stops. |
| Queue            | `WORD_EXPORT_QUEUE` | Async `.docx` export. |
| Stream binding   | `STREAM` (optional) | Cloudflare Stream video backend. Absent → video stays on R2, which is the default. |

⚠️ **`npm run setup:cloudflare` does not provision all of them.** It creates the
D1 database, **one** KV namespace (`TENANT_CACHE`) and the `PHOTOS` R2 bucket,
and writes their real IDs into a gitignored `wrangler.local.jsonc` (bootstrapped
from the committed placeholder `wrangler.jsonc`). The two queues and the second
KV namespace are not created by it, and `wrangler.jsonc` carries a placeholder id
for `OAUTH_KV`. Create them yourself before the first deploy:

```bash
npx wrangler queues create openinspection-cron
npx wrangler queues create openinspection-word-export
npx wrangler kv namespace create openinspection-oauth   # then paste the id over the
                                                        # OAUTH_KV placeholder in
                                                        # wrangler.local.jsonc
```

Durable Objects, the Workflow, `BROWSER`, `IMAGES` and `STREAM` are name-only
bindings — declaring them in the config is all the provisioning they need.

> **`IMAGES` is optional.** The committed `wrangler.jsonc` declares it (an
> account-scoped, name-only binding). If your account has **Images →
> Transformations** enabled (the Free plan includes 5,000 transformations/month),
> Word exports embed downscaled ~960px JPEGs. If it is not enabled, the deploy
> still succeeds, `env.IMAGES` is simply unset, and the Word-export consumer
> embeds originals up to a hard byte budget (photos beyond it are omitted) so a
> large report never exceeds the isolate memory limit.

### Minimum secrets

| Secret            | When required                                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `JWT_SECRET`      | Always — must be >= 32 random characters.            |
| `SETUP_CODE`      | First-run setup only — any value >= 6 characters; gates `/setup` (fail-closed if unset). |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`  | Optional, only if you want outbound email.          |
| `SENDER_EMAIL`    | Required when `RESEND_API_KEY` is set.              |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`  | Optional — read by the Advanced-settings "Test connection" diagnostic. AI features themselves run on the tenant's own key stored via Settings → Advanced → AI (or, in `saas` mode only, `AI_MANAGED_API_KEY`). |
| `AI_MODEL`        | Required for any AI feature — the model id every AI call uses, in the chosen backend's own naming. Through an AI gateway that is `{provider}/{model}`. There is no compiled-in default; unset means AI fails closed with a 503. A company may override it per workspace. |
| `AI_BASE_URL`     | Required for any AI feature — the root of the OpenAI-compatible API every AI call posts to. Point it at a hosted provider, at an AI gateway, or at an address on your own network running Ollama or vLLM. No compiled-in default; unset fails closed. A company may override it per workspace. See [AI](../integrations/ai.md). |
| `AI_MANAGED_API_KEY` | Optional, `saas` only — a deployment-provided AI key for tenants the deployment grants managed access to. A standalone deploy has no managed path and ignores it. |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | Optional but recommended for the public booking page. |

Set them via `wrangler secret put SECRET_NAME` or through the Cloudflare dashboard.

### Deploy the Worker

```bash
npm install
npm run setup:cloudflare   # provisions D1/KV/R2 + writes real IDs to wrangler.local.jsonc
npm run deploy             # build + wrangler deploy (uses wrangler.local.jsonc)
```

`npm run deploy` is the whole chain, in this order: `build` → `db:migrate:remote` → `db:lag` → `wrangler deploy` → `jwt:ensure` → `setup-code:ensure`. So **remote D1 migrations are applied by the deploy itself** — you do not need a separate `npm run db:migrate:remote` first, though running it on its own is a way to read the migration output before the build starts. `db:lag` sits between the migration and the deploy and aborts if the database and this checkout disagree about what has been applied. The build bakes whichever wrangler config wins (`WRANGLER_CONFIG` env > `wrangler.local.jsonc` > committed `wrangler.jsonc`).

> **One-click**: the committed `wrangler.jsonc` carries placeholder IDs; the README's *Deploy to Cloudflare* button provisions resources and injects real IDs automatically — no manual `setup:cloudflare` needed for that path.

### First-run setup code

First-run `/setup` is gated **solely** on the `SETUP_CODE` secret — the server reads `c.env.SETUP_CODE` and refuses to proceed when it is unset, so an unprotected Worker can't be claimed. It is any value >= 6 characters (compared for exact equality — no digit/charset constraint). You get one of two ways depending on how you deployed:

- **CLI** (`npm run deploy`): the final `setup-code:ensure` step (`scripts/ensure-setup-code.mjs`) generates a random `SETUP_CODE` and **prints it in the deploy output** — but only when the secret is MISSING. It never overwrites an existing value, so re-deploys keep your code. Provide your own first with `wrangler secret put SETUP_CODE` if you prefer.
- **One-click**: the wizard reads `.dev.vars.example` and surfaces `SETUP_CODE` as a secret field you fill in during deploy.

Then visit `https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/setup` and enter that value to bootstrap your first admin account.

### Publish the agent terms

The agent portal is **off until the deployment publishes a document written for
agents**, and nothing inside the product turns it on. A deployment that has not
published such a document cannot record anyone's agreement to one, so
`POST /api/agent-signup` refuses and the signup page closes itself. This is a
deployment-level document (`deployment_legal_versions`, doc `agent_terms`), not a
per-workspace one: no workspace administrator can supply it, and the gate does not
branch on `APP_MODE`, so a `saas` deploy needs it exactly as a self-hosted one does.

```bash
npm run agent-terms:publish -- --version YYYY-MM-DD            # local D1
npm run agent-terms:publish -- --version YYYY-MM-DD --remote   # remote D1
```

The tracked `app/content/legal/agent-terms.md` is a **template**: §1 names the
counterparty as "{{OPERATOR_NAME}} … which operates this deployment", and who that
is differs for every deployment. Write your own body to
`app/content/legal/agent-terms.local.md` instead — it is gitignored beside
`wrangler.*.jsonc` and `.dev.vars*` for the same reason, and the publisher prefers
it when present:

```bash
cp app/content/legal/agent-terms.md app/content/legal/agent-terms.local.md
# fill the operator fields, clear the draft status line, then publish
```

Editing the tracked template instead would make every deployment built from this
repository publish terms naming whoever edited it, and leave you carrying the
change as a permanent local diff. The header line the publisher prints names
whichever file it actually read, so a publish never leaves you guessing which text
was hashed.

`--version` is the date the text was **approved**, not today: it is shown to every
signer and stored on every acceptance, so deriving it from the clock would stamp
the deploy date onto a document approved on another day.

The script refuses rather than publish something half-finished. It strips HTML
comments first (the review status and the open questions live in comments so they
travel with the text under review without reaching a signer), then rejects a body
that still contains a `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`, or whose status line still says draft.
A liability cap reading `{{LIABILITY_FLOOR}}` is worse than no cap, because it
reads as a term. Publishing is idempotent on the **content hash**: the same words
published twice return the existing version, and changing the body under an
already-published version string is refused, because a version people accepted
cannot come to mean different words.

> **Symptom if you skip this**: everything else works and nothing logs an error,
> but agents reach *"Agent sign-up is not available yet"* with no way forward, and
> the agent portal stays unreachable for every workspace on the deployment.

### How the single worker is wired

The Worker entry at `workers/app.ts` is a Hono app. It routes API-owned paths (`/api/*`, `/status`, `/sign/*`, …) to the API app (`server/`) in-process, and sends every other path to React Router via `createRequestHandler` with `import("virtual:react-router/server-build")`, passing `{ cloudflare: { env, ctx } }` as the `AppLoadContext`. Before delegating to SSR it injects an in-process `API_WORKER` self-binding so React Router loaders/actions call the API app directly — no network hop, no second worker. `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` integrates the React Router SSR build with wrangler, so the standard `wrangler deploy` pipeline ships everything.

### Local development

```bash
npm run dev:hmr      # Vite dev server with HMR (react-router dev, port 5173) — fast iteration
npm run dev          # build-based: react-router build + wrangler dev (one worker, port 8787)
```

`npm run dev:hmr` is the everyday loop: instant hot updates for `app/` edits, and `server/` changes load through the worker entry's lazy API import. `npm run dev` is build-based (no HMR) and runs the real bundled worker on workerd — use it to verify production-shape behavior. Apply local D1 migrations first with `npm run db:migrate`. Note for contributors touching `workers/app.ts`: the entry must keep its top-level import graph tiny (the API is dynamically imported) — a static server import breaks the Vite dev runtime's export-type evaluation.

## Data retention & R2 lifecycle

OpenInspection is designed as a long-term evidence archive for inspectors — there is **no automatic deletion** of inspection data. Physical deletion happens only when an operator/integration explicitly purges a tenant (see *Tenant offboarding* below). To keep long-tail storage cheap without losing data, configure an R2 **lifecycle rule** on the `PHOTOS` bucket that transitions objects to the **Infrequent Access** storage class once they age past 365 days. This is a deploy-time/dashboard operation — no application code is involved.

- **Effect**: objects ≥ 365 days old move to Infrequent Access (~⅓ the storage cost). Reads still work transparently (a per-GB retrieval fee applies, latency is unchanged).
- **No expiry rule**: do NOT add a delete/expiry lifecycle action — that would erase evidence. Only the *transition* action is wanted.
- **D1 is untouched**: D1 has no storage classes and the row volume is small, so no lifecycle is needed there.

Configure it once per environment:

```bash
# Dashboard: R2 → PHOTOS bucket → Settings → Object lifecycle rules → Add rule
#   Action: "Transition to Infrequent Access", Age: 365 days, scope: whole bucket.

# Or via Wrangler:
wrangler r2 bucket lifecycle add PHOTOS ia-after-365d \
  --ia-transition-days 365
```

> A hosted/managed deployment runs the same rule on its own `PHOTOS` bucket. Self-hosters who do not want Infrequent Access can simply skip this step — it is a cost optimization, not a correctness requirement.

### Tenant offboarding (export then purge)

When a tenant is offboarded, the platform first builds a **full data export** ZIP (CSV/JSON of inspections, templates and agreements **plus the photo bytes themselves** under `photos/`, size-bounded so large tenants stay within Worker memory limits; any object beyond the budget is listed in `photos-manifest.json` with `included: false`), then purges all tenant rows, R2 objects and KV keys. The purge writes a durable, non-personal **destruction record** (`tenant_destruction_records`: tenant id, row/object/byte counts, timestamp) that intentionally has no foreign key to `tenants` so it survives the deletion as compliance proof. These run via the integration endpoints `POST /api/platform/tenants/:slug/data-export` and `.../purge`.
