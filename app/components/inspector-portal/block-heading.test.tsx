/**
 * Two rules for the hub's cards, because it is a column of siblings a reader
 * scans rather than reads — so position has to carry meaning on its own:
 *
 *   1. The card header is a LABEL, never a control: title left, status right.
 *   2. Every card's actions live at the BOTTOM of the card.
 *
 * The header briefly carried an action slot for "the card's one entry action".
 * It read as random — People and Schedule got header buttons while Agreement
 * and Invoice got body buttons, and nothing on screen said why, because you
 * cannot see how many actions a card has before you look at it. It also could
 * never cover Report, which has six.
 *
 * This asserts the header holds nothing clickable, which is the half of the
 * rule a component test can hold still.
