/**
 * The shapes the import screens read off a run report, and the vocabularies
 * their controls offer.
 *
 * The REPORT shapes are re-declared here rather than imported from the report
 * service: that module reaches the database, and a route module that pulls one
 * in drags a Drizzle table definition into the client bundle. The report is JSON
 * over HTTP, and these are what that JSON is once it has been through the wire.
 *
 * The VOCABULARIES are the opposite call, and deliberately so. A contact's type
 * and a team role are closed lists whose single source of truth is a pure module
 * with no ORM in its graph, and both of those modules say in their own docblock
 * that every consumer must derive from them. Re-typing either list here would be
 * a mapping form that keeps offering `client` after the list has moved on, with
 * nothing to notice — and this feature exists because a silent wrong answer was
 * shipped once already.
 *
 * `role` subtracts `agent` — but the subtraction is no longer PERFORMED here.
 * It was, and so was the same subtraction in the adapter, beside a hand-written
 * `['owner', 'manager', 'inspector']` in the row describer and a third enum in
 * the remap schema. Four spellings of one list is three chances for a dropdown
 * to keep offering a role an upload has stopped accepting, so the list is now
 * read from the vocabulary module like the contact types beside it.
