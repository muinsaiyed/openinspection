/**
 * The 24-hour outbound cooling window (portal #98, spec §3.2).
 *
 * Platform-funded email to external recipients is unavailable for the first
 * 24 hours of a company's life. What this buys, stated honestly: it defeats
 * the signup -> blast -> abandon loop, which is cheap precisely because it is
 * instant. It does NOT stop a patient attacker; it converts an instant attack
 * into a delayed one. It is only a defence because something looks during the
 * window — see the portal signup-anomaly signal.
 *
 * TWO CONDITIONS, and neither of them is "this code lives in OI":
 *
 *   1. The DEPLOYMENT is SaaS. A self-hosted deployment sends on its
 *      operator's own credentials. That is not our reputation to protect and
 *      not our money, so there is nothing here to gate.
 *   2. The SEND is platform-funded. A tenant who configured their own SMTP /
 *      API key is in the same position as a self-hosted operator, and is
 *      exempt for the same reason — which is also what makes the escape hatch
 *      in the UI notice a real one rather than a consolation.
 *
 * WHY THE COST IS DELIVERABILITY, NOT SENDS. `inspectorhub.io` publishes
 * `p=reject` with Resend and SES aligned. The damage from 50 free emails per
 * throwaway company is what it does to paying customers' report email, not
 * the marginal cost of an SMTP call.
 *
 * ⚠️ There is deliberately NO SMS equivalent — see `../sms/managed-send-gate.ts`.

/**
 * The notification classes the window NEVER applies to, named one by one.
 *
 * These are the mails that deliver access to an account: block them and a
 * legitimate inspector who signs up on site is locked out of the product
 * rather than merely limited by it. `usage-quota-*` are on the list because
 * they are OUR message about OUR billing to the company owner — telling
 * someone they are about to lose the ability to create inspections is not
 * outbound marketing, and they are already sent on an unmetered service
 * (see `api/inspections/core.ts`), so this is belt and braces.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and each for a reason worth stating:
 *   - `agent-invite`, `agent-login-link`, `client-portal-login` — these go to
 *     EXTERNAL parties and carry a sign-in link. A fresh throwaway company
 *     blasting 50 "click here to sign in" mails at harvested addresses is
 *     exactly the phishing-shaped payload this window exists to delay.
 *   - `admin-test-send` — its route takes an arbitrary `to` address, so it is
 *     an arbitrary-recipient send path wearing a diagnostic label.
 *
 * ⚠️ A TYPO HERE IS SILENT. A misspelled id simply never matches, the class
 * stays gated, and a new company cannot receive a password reset. Nothing
 * fails loudly. `tests/unit/email/outbound-cooling-window.spec.ts` checks
 * every entry against the class registry for exactly that reason.
 *
 * ── The second kind of entry, and why it is not the first ───────────────────
 * `subject-export-ready` and `subject-erasure-confirmed` are exempt for a
 * DIFFERENT reason, and the distinction is worth keeping visible because the
 * two look alike from inside this file.
 *
 * The four above are account mechanics: they hand someone the keys to a
 * product, and holding them turns a rate limit into a lockout. That is a
 * product argument, and a future reviewer could reasonably reweigh it.
 *
 * These two are not a product argument. They carry a statutory right — the
 * answer to an access or erasure request, whose deadline runs against the
 * controller from the moment the request arrives. An abuse control may delay
 * our own outbound; it may not spend a day of someone else's legal clock. The
 * hold survives review as an abuse control ON THAT CONDITION, so this is not a
 * concession made to the exemption list, it is the term the hold exists under.
 *
 * The case is real rather than hypothetical: a subject request against a
 * brand-new company lands inside the first 24 hours by construction, which is
 * precisely the interval this window covers.
