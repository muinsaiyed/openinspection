/**
 * The order a form's dependency rules are applied in, and the refusal for a ring.
 *
 * -- THE LIMIT THIS ENDS -----------------------------------------------------
 * `applicability.ts` used to apply its rules in DECLARATION order against one
 * values object, and said so in as many words: a question whose controlling
 * field is itself conditional would be judged against a key that may or may not
 * have been removed yet. It also named the honest fix -- a dependency order
 * computed from the graph rather than a second pass -- and this is that.
 *
 * The form that needs it is FL OIR-B1-1802 Rev. 04/26, whose question 8 is
 * printed three levels deep:
 *
 *   sealed_roof_deck                    A / B / C   asked of every inspection
 *     sealed_roof_deck_method           four boxes  printed only under A
 *       ..._spray_foam_underside_...    one box     printed only under spray foam
 *
 * Judged in declaration order with the deepest rule first, the third of those
 * reads its controller's answer BEFORE the middle rule has removed it.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THAT ACTUALLY COSTS, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. It is NOT a wrong
 * document: a controller that stops applying while holding an answer is refused
 * by `refuseAnswerToAQuestionNobodyAsked` in either order, so nothing reaches
 * paper that should not. What the two orders disagree about is WHICH BOX IS
 * BLAMED, and the refusal is the part the inspector acts on. An inspection
 * answering "B. No Sealed Roof Deck" while recording a method of taped deck
 * seams and ticking the underside box is told, deepest-rule-first, that the
 * UNDERSIDE box is wrong — it is judged against a method that is still in the
 * values object and finds the wrong one there. Controllers first, it is told the
 * deck answer and the method disagree, which is where the contradiction is.
 *
 * The guarantee underneath is the stronger statement, and it is the one the
 * tests assert: what the form carries, or what it says when it refuses, is a
 * fact about the INSPECTION and not about the order somebody typed the rules in.
 *
 * -- WHY NOT "APPLY THE RULES TWICE" -----------------------------------------
 * Because such a fix is correct exactly as deep as the number of passes it
 * makes. Two passes settle a two-link chain and get a three-link one wrong, in
 * the same silent way as before and with a change in the tree that everybody now
 * believes. An order is either right at every depth or it does not exist, and
 * those are the only two outcomes worth shipping.
 *
 * -- THE GRAPH IS FUNCTIONAL, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS SHORT ---------------------
 * A rule names exactly ONE controlling field, so every node has at most one edge
 * leaving it. The order is therefore a DEPTH: a rule whose controller is
 * unconditional sits at 0, and every other sits one below its own controller.
 * Walking that single edge from a node reaches one of three things -- a field
 * that is not conditional, a node an earlier walk already measured, or a node
 * still on this walk. The third is a ring, and the walk is holding its members.

 * names the same first offender on every run rather than a different one each
 * time the keys are enumerated.
 *
 * @throws when the rules form a ring, naming every question in it. That is a
 *   property of the template alone, so it is also raised from
 *   `refuseUnusableDependencies` -- before any of this inspection's answers are
 *   read, where the other shape refusals live.
