/**
 * TCPA / D5 consent basis per contact-role KIND (Communication A3.2).
 *
 * Track L D5: only consumers need a recorded consent event; business
 * counterparties and staff are implied. The Communication design (2026-07-28
 * §3.5) widened that from "client key vs agent/inspector" to the role KIND
 * axis — every `kind: 'client'` profile is a consumer (including co_client and
 * any tenant-invented client role), and `other` is the bucket for Attorney /
 * Transaction Coordinator / Insurance Agent / Title Company.
 *
 * `sms_consent_log.recipient_type` mirrors these values so a capture path can
 * stamp non-client rows honestly. Consumer capture paths (booking form /
 * opt-in link / settings page / admin attest) record express grants;
 * agent/other/staff remain IMPLIED and no grant is ever recorded for them.
 *
 * A staff row may now be written, but ONLY as a revocation — a STOP is a
 * request to be left alone and it binds whatever the basis was. Never write a
 * staff `granted` row: that would put internal operational messaging inside
 * the consumer consent evidence, which is the pollution the layered program
 * exists to avoid. Do not unify agent/staff onto the client express UI solely
 * for carrier filings — describe the layers in TFV/campaign answers instead
 * (see docs/operate/sms-compliance.md).

/**
 * The `sms_consent_log.recipient_type` vocabulary, and the reason it is one
 * value longer than `ROLE_KINDS` rather than a separate list.
 *
 * Every contact-party kind must be stampable — that is what "mirror RoleKind"
 * in the ledger's own comment means, and a kind with nowhere to be recorded is
 * a kind whose messages go out unaudited. So the kinds are spread, not
 * retyped: a fourth kind becomes stampable by existing.
 *
 * `staff` is appended because it is NOT a contact-party kind: it is an
 * employee reachable under account/employment terms, never consumer consent.
 * It is a separate value precisely so a staff STOP can be recorded without
 * entering the consumer consent evidence a carrier filing rests on — see the
 * column comment in `db/schema/compliance.ts`, which reads this array.
