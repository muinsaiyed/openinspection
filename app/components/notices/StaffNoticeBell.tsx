/**
 * The inspector portal's Notices bell — the third consumer of <NoticeBell>.
 *
 * Reads on mount rather than from a loader: the sidebar renders on every page
 * of the app, and threading an inbox through the layout loader would put a
 * query on every navigation whether or not anyone looks at the bell. One
 * fetcher load per page is the same cost and stays local to this component.
 *
 * Staff notices carry no channels and therefore no remedies — there was no
 * delivery to fix. `onRemedy` is a no-op rather than an optional prop so the
 * shared component keeps ONE contract across all three portals.
