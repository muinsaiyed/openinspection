/**
 * The one public route that can charge a stranger — the booking deposit.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT THE EXISTING PAY-INTENT ROUTE. `POST /api/public/inspections/
 * {id}/pay-intent` is gated on `resolveClientActor`: a live client/co_client
 * portal grant, presented as a `?token=` or the portal session cookie. An
 * anonymous booker who submitted the public form thirty seconds ago has
 * neither — no contact grant is minted at booking — so every deposit would
 * 401. It also charges the INVOICE, and a deposit exists precisely because
 * there is no invoice yet.
 *
 * WHAT AUTHORISES THE CALL, stated plainly because it is a public money route
 * and the honest answer is narrow: the inspection id, which was handed to this
 * browser in the response to its own booking submission and exists nowhere
 * else. That is the same capability posture as `/invoice/:id`. What it can be
 * abused for is bounded and worth writing down — a stranger holding the id can
 * learn what deposit is outstanding, and can PAY it. They cannot read the
 * booking, move it, or take money out. Everything else is refused by the four
 * conditions below, and 404 is the answer to all of them so the route cannot be
 * used to probe which ids exist.
 *
 * The intent it mints carries `metadata.kind = 'deposit'`. Nothing is recorded
 * here and nothing is recorded when the browser says the card cleared — the
 * ledger row is written by the Stripe webhook, which is the only party that
 * knows whether money actually moved.
