/**
 * #67 — the cancellation flow, from the hub's lifecycle card.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED, and why each one is the feature rather than decoration:
 *
 *   1. THE QUOTE COMES FIRST. The confirm is unreachable until the priced
 *      outcome has been fetched and rendered. A flow that lets someone cancel
 *      before the fee appears defeats the entire policy ladder — the ladder
 *      exists so the person cancelling sees what it costs.
 *   2. THE REASON RE-PRICES. A no-show and a weather cancellation are different
 *      rungs, so changing the reason must re-ask rather than keep the figure
 *      from the previous one on screen.
 *   3. THE CONFIRMATION NAMES THE MONEY. Not "are you sure?" — the fee kept,
 *      the amount refunded, and that neither is reversible from this page.
 *   4. THE ACKNOWLEDGED FEE IS THE FEE THAT WAS SHOWN. The API refuses to charge
 *      a fee the caller has not echoed back, so a submit carrying a different
 *      number (or none) is the failure this assertion exists to catch.
