 * still open", and the two diverge the moment anything is revoked. Showing
 * them as one list would imply they never do.
 *
 * Three states, and they must stay distinguishable, because an operator
 * checking who can still open a report ACTS on the answer: known-and-listed,
 * known-to-be-empty, and lookup-failed. `accessFailed` exists because the
 * loader used to swallow a 400 into an empty array, so the page told an
 * operator "this contact cannot open any reports" about someone holding two
 * live links — a failure rendered as an authoritative negative, which is the
 * dangerous direction here. In that state the revoke controls are withheld
 * too: offering "Revoke all" over an unknown set invites the belief that the
