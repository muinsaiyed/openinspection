/**
 * Editor-header visibility table — the single source for which COMPOSE-tier
 * control lives in the header row and which lives in the "More" overflow, at
 * every width.
 *
 * The header and the overflow menu are two lists that must be exact
 * complements: a control visible in both is duplicated, and a control in
 * neither is unreachable — which is precisely how Preview came to be
 * `2xl`-gated while Publish stayed always-on, leaving the whole 768-1279px
 * band (iPad landscape included) able to publish a report it could not look
 * at first.
 *
 * Rather than restate the pairing in a comment on each side, both sides import
 * these strings, so drift is not something anyone has to remember. `inline` is
 * the header button's class; `row` is the overflow row's. `header-visibility`
 * asserts they stay inverses.
 *
 * Tailwind scans .ts sources, so these literals are picked up for generation.
