/**
 * Spec 3 Task 3 — response shape for POST /api/agent/report-context, the
 * read-only probe the portal report-landing BFF loader
 * (app/routes/public/portal-inspection.tsx) uses to decide which CTA to
 * render below the report: "Go to my workspace" (magic-login) vs "Create
 * your free agent account" (signup). The request body reuses
 * MagicLoginRequestSchema's shape (tenant/inspectionId/token) — see
 * server/api/agent/report-context.ts.
 *
 * `kind: null` covers BOTH an invalid/expired/mismatched token and a token
 * that never had a role at all — this is a context probe, not an auth
 * check, so a bad token still replies 200 rather than 401 (the report
 * itself renders regardless; the CTA below it just doesn't show).
