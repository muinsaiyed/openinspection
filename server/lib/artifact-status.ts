/**
 * Whether a stored deliverable is still the current answer, and whether a
 * correction may be delayed for it.
 *
 * ── Why this is one module rather than three copies ─────────────────────────
 * The signing workflow leaves three files in object storage for an envelope —
 * the signed PDF, the Certificate of Completion, and the evidence zip — and
 * each is served by its own helper in `server/api/evidence.ts` running its own
 * `r2.get`. There is no shared fetch layer, so a rule written at the fetch
 * site gets written three times, and the day one of them is missed nothing in
 * that file says so. The list, the classifier and the guard live here so the
 * three helpers consume one answer instead of each deriving their own.
 *
 * ── The classifier has no archive class, on purpose ─────────────────────────
 * Correction obligations commonly give softer treatment to archived or backup
 * systems. These three objects are not that: they are files the product hands
 * to a client whenever the client asks for them. Nothing in this deployment
 * writes an object it treats as an archive or a backup, so `ArtifactClass` has
 * no member for one — which means no key can be labelled as one by accident,
 * and a caller that asks to defer a correction gets a refusal rather than a
 * quiet delay. That refusal is the whole point of `assertNothingDeferred`: it
 * is the only rule here that speaks on a day nobody has had yet.
