# What leaves this process when an AI feature runs

Every AI feature in OpenInspection funnels through one method, sends text to one
third-party endpoint, and sends nothing else anywhere. This page states exactly
what that text contains, field by field, read from the code rather than from a
design document.

It exists because "we send inspection content to a model" is not a statement
anyone can act on. A data protection assessment, a subprocessor disclosure and a
tenant's own question ("does my client's address go to Google?") all need the
field list, and the field list is only true if it was read off the prompt
renderers — which is what was done here.

**Verified 2026-08-11; section 2 rewritten 2026-08-22** when the single
hard-wired vendor endpoint was replaced by one configurable OpenAI-compatible
adapter.

**Sections 2c and "Which key it is" updated 2026-08-24**, when a
deployment-provided credential gained a second shape — one that refreshes
itself, for a backend authenticating with short-lived tokens — and the
configured endpoint became capable of naming a processing region. Neither
change alters what is sent: the request body in section 2 and the prompt tables
in section 3 are untouched.

**Section 3 completed 2026-08-23.** It had claimed four prompts and there were
five: `translate-report-segments.v1` shipped and was never listed here, so for
that feature this page — and the sentence in `CLAUDE.md` pointing at it — were
false. It is listed below, along with `template-inference.v1`, which is not
released. **The gap is worth stating rather than quietly closing**: nothing
fails when a prompt is added without a row here, so the only thing keeping this
list true is somebody checking it against `server/lib/ai/prompts.ts`, and that
had not happened for one release.

Every claim carries an evidence level:

| level | means |
|---|---|
| **E2** | read in the source of this repository, at the file named beside it |
| **E3** | checked against a running production deployment |
| **E4** | observed end to end in production, not inferred from a test |

Nothing on this page is above E2. No claim here was checked against production;
where a fact can only be established that way, it says so instead of guessing.

---

## 1. The chokepoint

`AIService.callGemini` (`server/services/ai.service.ts`) is the only method in
the codebase that sends text to a model. **E2.** It takes a versioned prompt
object and its arguments — never a pre-rendered string — so no feature can send
text that cannot be traced to a named prompt.

Before anything leaves, in this order (**E2**):

1. **The capability gate** (`server/lib/ai/capability-policy.ts` reading the
   posture table in `server/lib/ai/output-classification.ts`) decides whether
   this product generates this kind of output on these credentials at all.
2. **The model check** — an unconfigured `AI_MODEL` fails closed; there is no
   compiled-in default.
3. **The allowance pre-flight** — read-only, and only for platform-funded calls.
4. **The provenance write** — a row in `ai_call_provenance` recording provider,
   credential source, model, prompt version and the workspace's AI configuration
   version. It is awaited, so a sink that cannot write stops the send rather
   than letting content leave untracked. `provider` is read off the adapter
   instance that is about to run, so the row names the backend that actually
   served the call rather than the one configuration suggests.

Only then does the adapter run. The usage counter moves *after* a successful
response, never before.

## 2. The endpoint

⚠️ **THE DESTINATION IS NOW CONFIGURABLE, AND THIS SECTION NO LONGER NAMES ONE
VENDOR.** It used to describe a single hard-wired endpoint. It cannot any more:
the operator sets `AI_BASE_URL`, and a workspace may override it for itself.
Answering "where does our inspection text go" therefore requires reading this
deployment's configuration — the code alone cannot tell you.

`server/lib/ai/providers/openai-compatible.ts` is the only file that knows the
wire shape, and there is only one. **E2.**

```
POST {base}/chat/completions
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {apiKey}
```

`{base}` is, in precedence order (`server/lib/ai/resolve-provider.ts`, **E2**):

1. `tenant_configs.ai_base_url` — the workspace's own endpoint, read **only**
   on the workspace's own key. A workspace with no key of its own cannot
   redirect a platform-funded call.
2. `AI_BASE_URL` — the deployment default.

The request body is exactly:

- `model` — the configured model id (section 2a).
- `messages[0]` — `{ role: 'user', content: <the rendered prompt> }` (section 3).
- `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`.

**No other field is sent.** There is no inspection identifier, no user
identifier and no request id in the body. `topK` is **not** sent: the OpenAI
chat-completions schema has no such field, and it is dropped rather than
translated into a guess.

The API key travels in the `Authorization` header rather than the query string,
which is a change for the better: a URL reaches logs, proxies and error
reporters far more readily than a header does.

### 2a. Two headers, on the managed path only

When — and only when — the configured host is Cloudflare AI Gateway, two
headers are added (**E2**):

- `cf-aig-collect-log-payload: false`. That gateway stores request and response
  bodies **by default**, and these bodies carry client names and addresses. It
  is set in code on every request rather than in the gateway dashboard,
  because a dashboard toggle can be changed back by anyone and nothing would
  report it. Metadata, token counts, cost and duration survive; the payload
  does not.
- `cf-aig-metadata: {"tenant_id": …}`. A workspace identifier, so gateway cost
  is attributable. **This is the one place a workspace identifier leaves the
  process**, it goes only to that gateway, and it never accompanies a request
  to a workspace's own provider.

The host test is anchored on the parsed hostname, so a look-alike domain does
not receive either header. A direct connection — a workspace's own provider, or
a self-hosted deployment's endpoint — carries neither, and does not involve any
gateway at all.

### 2b. What a self-hosted operator controls

When OpenInspection is self-hosted and configured to use an AI endpoint running
within the operator's own network, inspection data sent to that AI endpoint does
not need to leave that network. Actual data flows depend on the operator's
configuration and any third-party services they enable.

This is a statement about what the software makes possible, not a guarantee
about any particular deployment: this repository ships the client, and it cannot
observe where an operator pointed it.

### 2c. The endpoint may encode a processing region

Some backends publish their OpenAI-compatible root with a **region in the URL
itself** — the host, the path, or both naming the location that serves the
request. Where a deployment is configured against such a backend, `AI_BASE_URL`
is the place where "where is inspection text processed" is written down, and it
is the only place: no region is compiled in, none is composed in code, and
nothing else in this repository records one. **E2.**

(Not to be confused with section 6, which is about a different question
entirely — which service tier a credential is on, and which users it may
therefore serve. That one is a property of an account, not of an address.)

Two consequences, stated rather than left to be inferred:

- **Answering the question requires reading this deployment's configuration.**
  Neither the code nor this page can answer it — the same limitation section 2
  already states about the destination as a whole, of which the region is part.
- **Changing `AI_BASE_URL` can move the processing location** with no code
  change and with nothing in this repository noticing. A deployment that has
  told anyone where its inspection text is processed has made a statement about
  a configuration value, not about this software, and it stops being true the
  moment that value changes.

⚠️ **Not verified against any running deployment.** This describes what the
configuration means, not what any deployment is set to.

### Which key it is

Credentials are resolved per call by `server/lib/ai/resolve-provider.ts`
(**E2**):

- A workspace's **own** stored key always wins, in every deployment mode.
- A **deployment-provided** key (`AI_MANAGED_API_KEY`) may serve a workspace
  where `profile.hasManagedAi` is true and the deployment grants that workspace
  managed access. A deployment that never provisioned such a key resolves the
  feature OFF rather than raising a credential error mid-report.
- A self-hosted deployment has no managed path at all — the workspace's own key
  or nothing.

A deployment-provided credential comes in **two shapes**, and which one is in
use changes nothing about what is sent, only about how the request is
authenticated (**E2**):

- a **long-lived key** (`AI_MANAGED_API_KEY`), spent as it stands; or
- a **service account** (`AI_VERTEX_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`), for a backend that
  issues only short-lived access tokens. A signed assertion is exchanged for a
  token, which is held in the worker isolate until shortly before it expires
  and **is not written to any durable store**. The private key is used to sign
  and never leaves the process; neither it, the assertion, nor the token is
  logged or included in any error message.

A workspace never supplies a credential of the second shape — that is
deployment configuration. **A deployment credential that is missing or
unusable resolves the feature OFF**, rather than raising an error partway
through a report, and the refusal is reported as the deployment's to fix and
never as a question about the workspace's own key.

The two paths are metered apart (`ai_*` versus `ai_*_byo`) so the volume a
deployment funds is never confused with the volume a workspace funds.

## 3. What is in the text, prompt by prompt

Six prompts exist (`server/lib/ai/prompts.ts`). **E2 for every row.** "Free
text" means an inspector typed it and it may therefore contain anything the
inspector chose to type, including names and addresses. Everything else is
structured data drawn from a template or a numeric property fact.

### `professional-comment.v1` — `POST /api/ai/comment-assist`

| field | source | free text? |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | the inspector's rough note | **yes** |
| `context` | optional caller-supplied context string; renders as `General inspection` when absent | **yes** |

### `inspection-summary.v1` — `POST /api/ai/auto-summary`

| field | source | free text? |
|---|---|---|
| `defects` | the `notes` of every result whose status is `Defect`, joined one per line; a defect with no note contributes the literal `No description provided` | **yes** |

The route is called with an `inspectionId`, and **the id does not leave the
process** — it selects rows. Neither the property address nor any contact name
is read into this prompt. What reaches the model is the defect notes and nothing
else.

### `rewrite-comment.v1` — `POST /api/ai/comment/edit`

| field | source | free text? |
|---|---|---|
| `itemLabel` | template item label | no |
| `sectionTitle` | template section title | no |
| `tab` | one of `information` / `limitations` / `defects` | no |
| `category` | optional; one of `safety` / `recommendation` / `maintenance`; rendered only on the `defects` tab | no |
| `location` | optional; rendered only on the `defects` tab | **yes** |
| `originalComment` | the comment being revised | **yes** |
| `instruction` | what the inspector asked for | **yes** |

`location` is a place *within* the building ("north-west corner"), but it is an
open string: an inspector may type anything into it. It is listed as free text
for that reason, not because the feature intends it to carry identifiers.

### `suggest-comment.v1` — `POST /api/ai/suggest-comment`

| field | source | free text? |
|---|---|---|
| `itemName` | template item name | no |
| `sectionName` | template section name | no |
| `rating` | optional rating value | no |
| `yearBuilt` | optional integer | no |
| `sqft` | optional integer | no |

**This prompt sends no free text at all**, and the closed field list is
deliberate. The request schema used to accept a `propertyAddress` that the
prompt never rendered — the address was validated and then dropped, which was
the right outcome resting entirely on a comment. The field was deleted rather
than guarded, and `tests/unit/ai/prompt-address-boundary.spec.ts` fails if an
identifier of the property or the client is added back. **E2.**

### `translate-report-segments.v1` — the courtesy translation of a report

| field | source | free text? |
|---|---|---|
| `segments` | report prose, in report order — the inspector's notes and comments, and anything a client or agent typed that the report renders | **yes** |
| `targetLocale` | BCP-47 target language tag | no |
| `glossary` | building-terminology map, English term to the approved target term | no |
| `context` | which part of the report the segments came from, e.g. a section title | no |

**What is NOT in this prompt is the point of it, and it is enforced by the
argument type rather than by review.** `TranslateSegmentsPromptArgs` has no
field for the property address, the client, the inspector, a signature, or any
agreement text — so the prompt cannot ask for them and no route can supply
them. Widening that interface is what would re-open it. **E2.**

`segments` is the largest free-text field on this page: it is whatever the
inspector wrote. The count is load-bearing rather than incidental — translated
segments are re-inserted positionally into the English structure, so a response
of the wrong length is rejected rather than mapped
(`server/lib/ai/translate-response.ts`). **E2.**

### `template-inference.v1` — deriving a template's outline from a document

⚠️ **NOT RELEASED. No call is made on any credentials today.**
`server/lib/ai/output-classification.ts` refuses the `template_inference` class
on both credential sources, and the chokepoint asks that table before anything
leaves the process — so this row describes what WOULD be sent, and nothing has
been. Releasing it is an edit to that table, reviewed as a product decision.
**E2.**

| field | source | free text? |
|---|---|---|
| `pages` | text extracted from a PDF the workspace uploaded, one string per page | **yes** |

Three facts about that single field, because it is the whole prompt:

1. **It is text this repository produced, never the file.**
   `server/lib/migration-intake/pdf-text.ts` reads the document's content
   streams and returns strings. It has no branch that emits image data, no
   parameter through which a caller could ask for any, and it returns `null`
   rather than a guess when a font's encoding is not one it can read. The
   document itself is never sent anywhere. **E2.**
2. **A document carrying personal information is refused before this point.**
   `server/lib/migration-intake/pii-scan.ts` runs over the same extracted text
   and blocks the upload on a match. It refuses; it does not remove anything,
   so nothing here rests on a cleaning step having worked. ⚠️ **A clean scan is
   a pattern match, not a verdict** — the interface says so where the operator
   reads it, and this page says so here. **E2.**
3. **The pages reach the prompt unfiltered.** Nothing between the scan and the
   prompt drops lines, and that is deliberate: a renderer that quietly removed
   what it disliked would make the refusal in (2) look as though it had worked
   while sending the rest.

### Photographs

No AI feature in this repository sends an image. Every prompt above renders to a
single text part; the adapter has no multimodal path. **E2.**

**Re-checked 2026-08-23, when a feature that starts from a PDF was added.** That
is the change most likely to have broken this sentence, and it did not:

- `AiRequest` (`server/lib/ai/provider.ts`) still carries `prompt: string` and
  four sampling numbers. No binary field, no parts array, no attachment. **E2.**
- The PDF feature's argument type carries `pages: readonly string[]` and nothing
  else — there is no field on it through which a file could travel, so the
  prompt cannot render one. **E2.**
- The extractor those strings come from cannot produce image data: it reads only
  the text-showing operators of a page's content stream, skips the operator that
  paints an image, and skips an inline image block whole rather than tokenising
  through its bytes. **E2.**

If a future change adds a binary or multimodal field to `AiRequest`, this
paragraph stops being true and must change with it. That is a change to what
this software discloses, not an interface tidy-up.

## 4. What is recorded on this side

`ai_call_provenance` holds one row per call: tenant, credential source, model,
provider id, prompt version, timestamp. **The prompt text is not stored** — not
truncated, not hashed, not the first line. The entry type has no field that
could carry it, which is the enforcement rather than a policy. **E2.**

`usage_counters` holds a count per workspace, per metric, per calendar month.
Counts only, no content. **E2.**

## 5. The terms the endpoint is subject to

Google publishes two different sets of terms for the same Gemini API endpoint,
and which one applies is a property of the **billing project the API key belongs
to** — not of the request, the model id, or anything in this repository.

- **Unpaid / free tier.** Google states that prompts and responses may be used
  to improve Google products, and that human reviewers may read them. Content
  submitted on an unpaid key must therefore be treated as disclosed to Google
  for its own purposes.
- **Paid tier.** Google states that prompts and responses are not used to
  improve Google products, and that abuse-monitoring logs are retained for a
  limited period (Google documents 55 days at the time of writing). Google's
  processor terms apply, and they are accepted **by use** rather than by
  signature.

Authoritative sources, which override this page if they diverge:

- Gemini API Additional Terms of Service — <https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms>
- Gemini API pricing and tiers — <https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing>
- Google Cloud Platform Terms / Data Processing Addendum — <https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-addendum>

**These are Google's statements, cited, not verified by this repository.** They
are the reason section 6 exists.

## 6. The region rule, and the thing the software cannot check

**Only a paid-tier key may serve users in the EEA, Switzerland or the United
Kingdom.**

The tier is a property of the key's billing project. **The software cannot
detect it.** There is no field in the request, no field in the response, and no
API this repository calls that reports which tier a key is on. `AI_MODEL` does
not imply it and neither does the model's behaviour.

### What the stored attestation is, and is not

`tenant_configs.ai_key_attestation_*` records what the workspace **stated**
when it saved its own key: the provider, the endpoint, the model, the service
tier, the intended use, and the `ai_config_version` those statements were made
about.

It proves that those representations were made, at that configuration version.
It does **not** prove that the endpoint was reachable, that it was the endpoint
that served any particular call, that the tier is what the provider's own
records say, or that the stated use is the use it was put to. Nothing in this
codebase verifies any of them, and no endpoint it calls would report them.

The one thing that speaks to what actually ran is `ai_call_provenance`, and it
speaks by observation: `provider` is read off the adapter instance that was
about to be called, never off configuration. `config_version` joins the two, so
a stored claim and the calls it was supposed to cover can be **compared** — an
attestation whose `ai_key_attestation_config_version` trails
`ai_config_version` is a workspace that changed its destination after
attesting. Reading a row in either table as evidence of the other is the misuse
to avoid.

Three consequences, stated plainly because each one has been assumed away
before:

1. **A deployment-provided key must be confirmed as paid-tier by a person**,
   once, before it is provisioned, and that confirmation recorded as evidence.
   No code path can re-check it later.
2. **A workspace's own key is the workspace's own responsibility.** The
   deployment cannot see that key's tier either. This is why the
   bring-your-own-key path asks a workspace to confirm what its own provider
   account permits before the key may be used.
3. **A key silently downgraded** — billing removed from the project — keeps
   working and starts falling under the unpaid terms, with nothing in this
   system able to notice. Monitoring that is a billing-account task, not an
   application one.

## 7. Open items

- **Sections 5 and 6 are E2-by-citation only.** Nobody has re-read Google's
  pages as part of this write-up; the statements are carried over from the
  review that commissioned it. Re-checking them, with the date, is worth
  doing before any disclosure quotes this page.
- **No production observation.** Whether any AI call has ever been made on this
  deployment, and on which credential source, is an E3/E4 question about
  `ai_call_provenance` and `usage_counters` that this document does not answer.
