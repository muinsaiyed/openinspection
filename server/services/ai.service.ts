/**
 * The AI-powered features, over whichever backend was resolved for the request.
 *
 * IT NO LONGER KNOWS WHICH BACKEND THAT IS. The adapter arrives already built
 * from `lib/ai/resolve-provider.ts`, which is the single place that decides
 * credentials, endpoint and model. A workspace's own stored key always wins
 * there; where the deployment profile permits it (`hasManagedAi`) a
 * deployment-provided key may serve workspaces granted managed access instead.
 * This class re-derives none of that, and constructs no adapter of its own —
 * doing so would be a second answer to a question one module owns.
 *
 * HAVING credentials is not the same as the product OFFERING the capability
 * they would fund. `lib/ai/capability-policy.ts` holds that second answer and
 * `callGemini` asks it on every call, so a platform key appearing in the
 * environment cannot by itself release a capability nobody decided to ship.
 *
 * The PROMPTS live in `lib/ai/prompts.ts`, each under a stable version token,
 * so the largest input to a model's output is nameable rather than an inline
 * literal that can be reworded in passing. `callGemini` records provider /
 * mode / model / prompt version / timestamp to `ai_call_provenance` before
 * anything leaves the process; without that the version tokens were a naming
 * convention producing no evidence about any output ever generated.
 *
 * On a deployment that offers it (`aiDevMockFallback`), a missing key yields
 * the `[DEV]` placeholders in `lib/ai/dev-mock.ts` so the UI flow can be
 * exercised end to end. Everywhere else a missing key throws
 * `Errors.AINotConfigured` (503) so the client can route the inspector to AI
 * settings instead of showing a silent failure.
 *
 * The MODEL is configuration, never a source constant. There is deliberately
 * no baked-in default: a model id compiled into the binary is how a request
 * URL ends up pinned to one model with no way to change it, and a fallback
 * would hide the same mistake next time. Unconfigured fails closed.
