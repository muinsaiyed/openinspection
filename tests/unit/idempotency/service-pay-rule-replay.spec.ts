/**
 * Retry safety for the pay-rule write surface (#278).
 *
 * A pay rule is not itself money, but it is the multiplier every future split
 * on that service is derived from, so a duplicate is a money-shaped defect: two
 * rules in the same slot and `pickRule` picks one arbitrarily, which means what
 * an inspector earns depends on insertion order.
 *
 * The partial unique indexes stop the duplicate ROW. What they do not fix is
 * what a retry SEES: unguarded, the second POST of the same create is a 409
 * saying a rule already exists — indistinguishable, from the client's seat, from
 * a colleague having added one in another tab. The guard turns the retry into a
 * replay of the original 201, which is the honest answer: the request succeeded,
 * this is what it created. That is the difference these specs pin.
 *
 * PUT and DELETE are asserted for the same reason and are weaker hazards: PUT
 * writes an absolute rate, and a retried DELETE unguarded 404s on a rule that
 * the caller did in fact delete. Both are labelled for what they are.
