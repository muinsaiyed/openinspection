/**
 * The agent terms are a gate in front of every agent session, not a checkbox on
 * one form.
 *
 * There are three ways to hold an agent session and only one of them ever sees a
 * consent screen:
 *
 *   1. `POST /api/agent-signup`   — records the acceptance, already fail-closed
 *   2. `POST /api/agent/login`    — password, for an account that exists
 *   3. `GET  /agent/magic-login`  — emailed link, for an account that exists
 *
 * Two and three mint a 24-hour cookie and ask nothing. This file drives both of
 * them for real — sign in, take the cookie the route actually set, present it on
 * a protected agent route — because the only assertions that mean anything here
 * are about what a real request gets back. A harness that called the middleware
 * directly would pass whether or not it was ever mounted.
 *
 * ── The positive control is not decoration ──────────────────────────────────
 * Every refusal below is paired with a request that must SUCCEED: an agent who
 * accepted the version in force sails through the same gate on the same path
 * with the same cookie. A gate that blocks everything looks identical to a
 * working gate in a suite that only asserts blocking.

         * ledger — every version they accepted, when, and the text that was
         * actually shown at the time. It takes no input at all: no query
         * parameter, no path parameter, no body, and therefore no account

         * all. Answering "not until you accept these terms" to somebody asking
         * what they already accepted is the loop the exemption principle exists
         * to prevent — and it is worst for the agent who thinks they already
         * signed and wants to check.
         *
         * The exemption is from the GATE, not from authentication: the handler
         * checks `agentUserId` itself and 401s an anonymous caller, which is why

     * The notification-preference surface, and what a gated agent can and
     * cannot do about the email aimed at them.
     *
     * These four paths are GATED, and this block pins that rather than
     * describing it, because the reason they are gated turns on facts that can
     * change under them.
     *
     * The fact that matters: a blocked agent is not without a way out. Every
     * suppressible message sent to them carries its own unsubscribe link
     * (`server/lib/notifications/unsubscribe-footer.ts`), the page that link
     * lands on is mounted under `/api/public` and is structurally outside this
     * gate — the JWT middleware short-circuits before anybody is classified —
     * and the write it performs covers every subject the address stands for,
     * which is at least as much as the in-product switch writes. So a gated
     * agent can already stop the mail; what they cannot do is manage it from
     * inside the product.
     *
     * The three conditions that finding rests on are worth stating, because if
     * any of them stops holding, so does the reasoning: the link is minted only
     * where the send has a resolved tenant, a signing secret, and a configured
     * public base URL. A deployment with no base URL sends the message with no
     * footer at all.
     *
     * And these are not withdrawal endpoints. Both writes take a direction —
     * `enabled: boolean` on one, `enable | disable | reset` on the other — so
     * the same path that switches a message off switches it on. `sms-consent`
     * is further from the others still: it GRANTS consent to be texted, and an
     * exemption there would produce a consent record made by somebody who was
     * being told to sign something at the time. They share a URL prefix and not
     * an answer.

 *
 * `scripts/publish-agent-terms.mjs` refuses a body that still carries a
 * `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` or whose status line still says draft, and the shipped
 * `app/content/legal/agent-terms.md` carries both. So no version is ever in
 * force out of the box, `agentTermsStatus` takes its `no_document` branch, and
 * every signed-in agent passes. Whether the platform should ship a control that
 * is a no-op until an operator publishes is a product decision; this is what
 * stops it from being an accident.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHEN THIS GOES RED, DELETE IT — do not loosen it. Red here means the text
 * was approved and the gate started enforcing, which is the event this exists to
 * announce. Softening it back to green would restore exactly the silence it was
 * written to break.
