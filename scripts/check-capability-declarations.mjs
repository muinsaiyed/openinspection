/**
 * Capability declaration gate (Task 15, two-layer role model).
 *
 * A route that mounts requireCapability('X') must also declare it in its
 * withMcpMetadata meta as `capability: 'X'`, and vice versa. The runtime
 * authorization-surface spec (tests/unit/platform/authorization-surface.spec.ts)
 * proves the same agreement against the LIVE route registry, but it runs late
 * (full test suite / CI); this catches the drift at commit, in the file being
 * edited, where it is cheapest to fix. The two are complementary: this script
 * sees one file and cannot know the registry; the spec sees the registry and
 * cannot point at the line you just typed.
 *
 * Pairing model: each `createRoute(withMcpMetadata(` occurrence opens a window
 * that runs to the next occurrence (or EOF). Within a window, the multiset of
 * `requireCapability('X')` mounts must equal the multiset of `capability: 'X'`
 * declarations. A window belongs to exactly one route definition because the
 * repo's route files declare one createRoute per const.
 *
 * console.* is intentional — this is a build script, not server code.
