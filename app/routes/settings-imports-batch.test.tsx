/**
 * `/settings/imports/:batchId` — one run, on its own address.
 *
 * A wizard is the easiest thing in this codebase to test vacuously. "The
 * mapping step renders" is true of nearly every run, "the Next button is
 * disabled" is true of the last step of every run, and both would stay green
 * against a shell that had no rules at all. So every assertion below either
 * COMPARES two runs differing in exactly one property, or names which step is
 * CURRENT rather than merely present, or reads the blocked SENTENCE and watches
 * it change as each condition is met.
 *
 * The three things this page decides, and where each is pinned:
 *
 *   1. which steps this run has — asserted as an ordered list against a run
 *      that differs by one property, in both directions;
 *   2. where the run OPENS — the landing step, which is not "the first step"
 *      and is not the same for a run with problems as for a clean one;
 *   3. which of the two screens a run gets — the wizard, or the waiting
 *      screen, which is itself two different screens depending on whether this
 *      deployment has anybody to hand the file to.
