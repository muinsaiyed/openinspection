/**
 * Track I-a GDPR (spec §7) — the retention sweep (daily Cron step).
 *
 * Past-retention-window data-minimization of signed agreements. The orchestrator
 * (`erasure-orchestrator.ts`) erases the SATELLITE PII in place on a DSAR while
 * KEEPING signature_base64 + the audit chain as the retained evidence; this
 * sweep is the back-end clock that, once the tenant's retention window has
 * elapsed past `signedAt`, CLEARS that same satellite PII AND destroys the
 * signature in one pass. Retention-expiry is therefore a SELF-CONTAINED
 * data-minimization clock — independent of whether any DSAR was ever filed
 * (GDPR Art. 5(1)(e) storage limitation; we must not keep PII forever just
 * because no one asked to erase it).
 *
 * For each tenant, a signed `agreement_requests` row is "past window" when
 *   signedAt + tenant_configs.agreement_retention_years < now.
 * The per-tenant year is applied via a single cross-tenant join to
 * `tenant_configs` (NO N+1: one grouped SELECT, then one UPDATE per due envelope's
 * scope). Already-purged rows (`purged_at IS NOT NULL`) are skipped → idempotent.
 *
 * Action per due envelope:
 *  - ERASE IN PLACE the satellite PII on the envelope + its `agreement_signers`
 *    rows using the SHARED `ANONYMIZE_REQUEST_PII` / `ANONYMIZE_SIGNER_PII` SETs (the
 *    SAME column→value mapping the erase orchestrator uses, so a row erased first
 *    then swept stays byte-identical — '[erased]' sentinel for NOT NULL columns,
 *    NULL for nullable). Idempotent on already-cleared rows (re-setting the
 *    same values is a no-op in effect).
 *  - NULL `signature_base64` on the envelope's `agreement_signers` rows — the
 *    only place a signature lives (the orchestrator KEEPS it on a DSAR; the
 *    sweep destroys it).
 *  - Set `agreement_requests.purged_at = now` (the destruction marker / idempotency
 *    guard). `status` STAYS 'signed' — the agreement WAS signed; the truthful state
 *    plus the surviving esign_audit_logs chain remain the tamper-evident attestation.
 *
 * Hard rules: NEVER delete or touch `esign_audit_logs` (chain integrity — it is the
 * minimal PII-light attestation that survives final destruction). The summary line
 * carries counts ONLY — no PII, no token material.
