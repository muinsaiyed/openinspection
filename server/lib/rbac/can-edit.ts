/**
 * Design System 0520 subsystem C phase 4 — canEdit permission matrix.
 *
 * Pure decision function answering "is this user allowed to mutate this
 * inspection?".
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING IN PRODUCTION CALLS THIS. Write-bearing routes authorize with
 * `requireRole` + `requireCapability` only — a role/capability test, with no
 * per-inspection membership check. So the policy below ("an inspector may edit
 * an inspection they are on") is NOT currently enforced: within a tenant, any
 * inspector with the capability may edit any inspection. That may well be the
 * intended product behaviour; it is recorded here because the docstring used to
 * claim this function guarded every write, and it does not.
 *
 * Role outcomes:
 *   - owner / admin  → always true
 *   - inspector      → true when caller is on the inspection
 *   - agent          → false (buyer-agent view is read-only)
