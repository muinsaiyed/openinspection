/**
 * One door to `status = 'cancelled'` (#78).
 *
 * Cancelling an inspection is not a status write. `POST /api/inspections/:id/cancel`
 * prices the cancellation against the tenant's ladder, refuses to charge a fee
 * the caller has not acknowledged, appends the refund to the payment ledger,
 * records WHY in `cancel_reason`, and fires `inspection.cancelled`. A plain
 * status write does none of that — it produces a job that is cancelled in the
 * list view while the invoice still reads as owed and the deposit stays held,
 * with nothing anywhere saying the two disagree.
 *
 * So the other writers refuse. This is the refusal, shared rather than copied,
 * because the failure mode is silent on BOTH doors and a second copy is how one
 * of them drifts back open. The cancel route's own comment already names the
 * surfaces it was worried about — "a bulk action, an MCP tool, a mobile client"
 * — and two of the three were real:
 *
 *   PATCH /api/inspections/:id    { status: 'cancelled' }               → ./patch-guards
 *   PATCH /api/inspections/bulk   { action: 'updateStatus', status: … } → ./bulk
 *
 * Both answer 400 with the code below. 400 rather than a status of its own
 * because it is the code both routes already use for a body they will not
 * apply, and the machine-readable part callers branch on is the `code`.
 *
 * ── The way BACK is one door too (#81) ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Leaving `cancelled` used to be a plain status write, and that left the same
 * shape pointing the other way: `POST /:id/uncancel` existed with no caller,
 * while the row dropdown PATCHed a new status straight on. The two did not
 * agree, and a third writer disagreed with both — printed side by side:
 *
 *   PATCH /:id { status }              cleared cancel_reason/notes, audited, re-pushed Google Calendar
 *   POST  /:id/uncancel                cleared cancel_reason/notes, NO audit, NO calendar
 *   PATCH /bulk { updateStatus }       LEFT cancel_reason/notes in place — a live job carrying "no_show"
 *   POST  /:id/complete                same leak, from cancelled straight to completed
 *
 * `POST /:id/uncancel` is now the one door back, doing everything the widest of
 * those did, and the others refuse with {@link refuseLeaveCancelledViaStatusWrite}.
 *
 * A FIFTH exists outside this module and is guarded where it lives:
 * `ConciergeService.confirmByClient` — a magic link, redeemable by someone who
 * is not signed in, minted before the client confirms and therefore capable of
 * arriving after a cancellation. It refuses in its own words rather than
 * sharing the refusal below: its reader is a client following an email link,
 * not a caller who can POST anywhere.
 *
 * THE MONEY DOES NOT COME BACK WITH IT. A kept fee and an issued refund are
 * ledger facts; the inspection returns to `scheduled`, and reversing either
 * amount is an invoice adjustment, not a status change. Copy at every door that
 * offers recovery has to say so.
