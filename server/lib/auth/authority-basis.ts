/**
 * On what basis does an acceptance bind anyone?
 *
 * The binary a row has to answer is: *can this person bind this company?* Not
 * "what is their role" — role is a different axis, and conflating the two is the
 * defect this vocabulary closes.
 *
 * ── ONE VOCABULARY ACROSS THE SEAM ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * These values are byte-identical to `AUTHORITY_BASES` in the portal
 * (`server/lib/auth/authority-basis.ts` there). The portal's copy already said
 * so — "these are also the values the engine's `account_acceptances.authority_basis`
 * declares" — while this file did not exist, so the claim was true about an
 * intention rather than about code. It is true about code now.
 *
 * The list is duplicated rather than shared because the two repositories do not
 * import from each other: the engine is open source and deployable by anyone,
 * and a runtime dependency on a private SaaS package would make that false. The
 * cost of duplication is that they can drift, which is why the acceptance block
 * arriving over the seam is validated against THIS enum on the way in — a
 * projection naming a basis this side cannot hold is refused at the boundary
 * rather than stored and discovered later.
