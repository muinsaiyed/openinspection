/**
 * <ReportSummaryStats> — the at-a-glance card row at the top of the report.
 *
 * The cards are derived from THIS inspection's own rating system
 * (Spectora-style), not from fixed Satisfactory/Monitor/Defects buckets: items
 * are tallied by their rating level and one card is rendered per level that
 * actually occurs, using that level's own label and colour, ordered good→bad by
 * severity bucket and then by first appearance. The derivation lives with the
 * render because the ordering rule is only meaningful as the reading order of
 * these cards.
 *
 * Commercial PCA Phase O — this block is the report's "PCA Summary"
 * front-matter page (registry id `pca-summary`), so it carries that anchor for
 * the TOC / PDF bookmarks. It renders unconditionally, so the anchor is never
 * dangling regardless of tier.
 *
 * lint:ds — only `ih-*` design tokens; raw Tailwind colors are forbidden.
