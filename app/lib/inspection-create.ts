/**
 * B-8 fix — map the New Inspection wizard's form fields to the
 * CreateInspectionSchema JSON that POST /api/inspections expects.
 *
 * The wizard posts a separate `date` (YYYY-MM-DD) + `time` (HH:MM); the API
 * wants a single ISO datetime, so we combine them here. `templateId` and
 * `propertyAddress` are required by the schema; `date`/`inspectorId`/
 * `serviceIds` are omitted when absent so the API applies its own defaults.
 *
 * `serviceIds` arrives as a comma-joined string of tenant service IDs (the
 * Services step now lists the tenant's real services, not free-text labels).
 * The service layer matches these against the `services` table and silently
 * ignores unknown IDs, so a stale/empty value is harmless.
 *
 * `inspectorId` is only forwarded when it looks like a UUID — the schema types
 * it as `z.string().uuid()`, and the wizard's free-text "Inspector ID or name"
 * field could otherwise carry a name that would fail validation.
 *
 * P-4 service price overrides:
 * - `serviceSelectionsJson` carries a JSON array of `{serviceId, priceOverrideCents?}`.
 *   When present, `serviceSelections` is forwarded to the API; the legacy `serviceIds`
 *   flat list is also emitted for backward compatibility with old callers.
 *   The server-side schema already treats serviceSelections as the superset that takes
 *   precedence over serviceIds when both are present (IA-1 server contract).
 *
 * IA-1 People step fields:
 * - `clientName/clientEmail/clientPhone` → `client{name,email?,phone?}` only
 *   when `clientName` is non-empty (omitting client entirely when no name).
 * - `agentContactId` → forwarded when it is a UUID (existing contact link).
 * - `newAgentName/newAgentEmail` → `newAgent{name,email?}` when `newAgentName`
 *   is non-empty and `agentContactId` is absent. The two are mutually exclusive
 *   in the UI; we enforce the same here: agentContactId wins if both are sent.

   * is how this field spent its whole life being silently discarded.
   *
   * ⚠️ Declared as the narrow union so the typed client accepts it, but the
   * VALUE is asserted rather than validated — see the single read site below,

   * unknown slug here: dropping a bad value in the BFF is the defect this field
   * is being fixed for.
   *
   * The assertion is kept next to the form read rather than at the client call,
   * and that placement is load-bearing for a reason worth recording: a cast at
   * the call site had to name the client method a second time, and the
   * middleware-budget gate counts those names as API fan-out. It read as a new
   * call that was not one. ⚠️ Naming the method in THIS comment does it too —
   * a content gate cannot tell prose from code, so describe it, do not spell it.
