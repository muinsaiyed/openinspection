/**
 * OI #58 — non-translatable content registry lint gate.
 *
 * Asserts the internal validity of the registry
 * (`server/lib/legal/non-translatable-manifest.ts` +
 * `non-translatable-out-of-scope.ts`) and HARD-FAILS when an entry has decayed
 * into a string that points at nothing.
 *
 * ── What this gate is FOR, given it guards a feature not yet wired up ───────
 * The `translation` output class is now RELEASED on a workspace's own provider
 * key (`server/lib/ai/output-classification.ts`), but nothing assembles a
 * report into segments yet, so the registry still has no runtime consumer and
 * will not have one until #23's pipeline ships. So the failure
 * mode it defends against is not a bad translation — it is the registry quietly
 * becoming untrue in the months before anything reads it. A `source` gets
 * renamed, a `locator` gets refactored away, someone adds another category to
 * the type and not to the list, and by the time #23 arrives the register looks
 * authoritative and covers half of what it claims.
 *
 * ── The scope is ENUMERATED, not discovered ─────────────────────────────────
 * Sibling gates (erasure, retention) derive their in-scope set from the schema
 * and then demand an answer for each member. This one cannot: "is this text a
 * term of a legal instrument" is not a property of a column name. The in-scope
 * set is the enumerated categories below, and it is closed. That makes
 * CATEGORY COVERAGE the load-bearing check here — a registry naming some of
 * them reads exactly like a complete one, and nothing else in the repo would
 * notice the ones it left out.
 *
 * The gate keeps its OWN copy of the list and compares it against the source's
 * `NON_TRANSLATABLE_CATEGORIES` in both directions. Two lists that must be
 * equal are printed side by side rather than trusted: a gate whose scope is
 * defined by the file it is checking can be narrowed by editing that file.
 *
 * HARD failures (exit 1):
 *   - either array missing / unparseable (the manifest is not optional)
 *   - ZERO manifest entries parsed          <- "found nothing" == "looked at nothing"
 *   - an entry missing a non-empty id / category / source / locator / reason
 *   - a `category` outside the required list
 *   - a required category with NO entry (coverage)
 *   - a `source` path that does not exist on disk
 *   - a `locator` that does not occur in its `source`
 *   - a manifest source that imports the message catalogue (`~/paraglide/…`)
 *   - a duplicate id, or an id in both arrays
 *   - an out-of-scope entry missing id / source / reason, or naming a missing file
 *   - the source category list and this gate's copy disagreeing either way
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-non-translatable.mjs
 *   node scripts/check-non-translatable.mjs --fixture scripts/fixtures/non-translatable-probe
 *
 * `--fixture` exists so the gate can be proven RED against a probe directory
 * instead of by breaking tracked source and reverting it. In fixture mode the
 * two arrays are read from `<dir>/probe-manifest.ts` and
 * `<dir>/probe-out-of-scope.ts`, and every entry `source` resolves relative to
 * `<dir>`. A probe that mutates tracked source is one interrupted run away from
 * being committed.
 *
 * console.* is intentional — this is a build script, not server code.
