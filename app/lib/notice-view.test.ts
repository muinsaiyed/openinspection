/**
 * The recipient-facing Notice view logic (design §3.16).
 *
 * The rules here exist because the reader is a CUSTOMER, not an operator, and
 * the two audiences must not share a reason map:
 *
 * - Only reasons that are ABOUT the recipient and ACTIONABLE BY THEM get
 *   words. "That automation has no template", "SMS isn't set up", "still under
 *   review" are our problems; telling a customer leaks operational state and
 *   buys a support ticket. Everything unrecognized collapses to a flat
 *   "Not delivered" with no explanation and no button.
 * - The client list is explicitly enumerated in BOTH directions, so adding a
 *   new internal reason code can never leak by default, and a transient
 *   provider failure never tells someone their address is wrong.
 * - A remedy is only offered where the path behind it exists: "Turn on texts"
 *   is real everywhere; the email remedy opens a composer, so it renders only
 *   where a composer exists (the client hub, not the agent portal).
