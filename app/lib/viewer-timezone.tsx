 * Viewer timezone for public, unauthenticated surfaces that carry no tenant
 * (observe / verify / concierge). These links have no
 * session context and no tenant slug, so there is no configured zone to anchor
 * to — the honest anchor is the viewer's own zone. Mainstream field-service
 * tools resolve times to the viewer's browser zone rather than defaulting
 * silently to UTC, and let them pick another zone when the guess is wrong.
 *
 * SSR-safe by construction: the initial value is "UTC" on the server AND on the
 * first client render, so hydration matches. After mount the effect resolves the
 * effective zone (a remembered choice from a prior visit, else the browser zone)
 * and the displayed times settle to it. No-JS / PDF-render viewers keep the UTC
 * anchor, which is the correct fixed fallback for a printed document.
