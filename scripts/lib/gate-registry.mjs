/**
 * The conformance-gate registry.
 *
 * One list, no side effects: the runner imports it to run gates, the
 * gate-registry gate imports it to prove nothing fell out of the chain, and the
 * spec imports it to check its invariants. Keeping it separate from
 * `run-gates.mjs` is what lets those other two consumers read it without
 * running every gate as an import side effect.
 *
 * `rung` says which ladder rung pays for the gate:
 *   PRECOMMIT — every commit. Adding one here costs every commit in the repo,
 *               so each entry below carries the argument for why it earns that.
 *   PUSH      — the full `npm run lint`, i.e. pre-push and CI's verify job.
 * A run at PUSH includes everything at PRECOMMIT; a run at PRECOMMIT does not
 * include PUSH.
