/**
 * AI call provenance — one row per prompt this deployment sends to a model
 * provider.
 *
 * WHY THE TABLE EXISTS. The prompts have carried stable version tokens
 * (`professional-comment.v1`, …) since they were extracted into
 * `lib/ai/prompts.ts`, and nothing read them: every call site rendered a string
 * and handed it to the provider. The governance artifact existed and produced
 * no evidence, so the question it was built to answer — which prompt produced
 * this text, on whose credentials, against which model, when — had no answer at
 * all, for any output ever generated. This table is that answer, written at the
 * one method every AI feature funnels through (`AIService.callGemini`), so no
 * capability can produce output without leaving a row.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO PROMPT TEXT IS STORED HERE, EVER, AND THAT IS A REQUIREMENT RATHER THAN
 * AN OVERSIGHT. The largest input to an AI call is inspector free text — a
 * defect note routinely names the client and the property address — so storing
 * the prompt would turn an accountability ledger into a second, unindexed copy
 * of client PII sitting outside every erasure path that exists for the first
 * one. Every column below is metadata ABOUT a call. Adding a column that
 * carries any part of the prompt, the completion, or an identifier of the
 * inspection is a compliance change, not a debugging convenience: it puts this
 * table into the erasure orchestrator's scope, which it is deliberately outside
 * of today (see the `ai_call_provenance` block in `erasure-manifest.ts`).
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT THE USAGE COUNTER. `usage_counters` answers "how much", as one
 * summed number per (tenant, metric, month) — it cannot say which prompt
 * version or which model produced any particular output, and making it able to
 * would mean abandoning the aggregate that makes it a meter. Two tables, two
 * questions; both are written from the same chokepoint on the same resolved
 * credential source, so they can disagree about volume only if one of them is
 * broken.

 * is none — acceptance is a separate, later write by whoever asked for the text.
 * Two events, two rows. They are joined on `ai_call_id`, and the join points AT

 * INTO that table is the compliance change its own comment above forbids, while
 * pointing at it from here adds nothing to it.

 * agree with the first and eventually will not — and the copy is the one a
