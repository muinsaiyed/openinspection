/**
 * OI #276 — the log-retention executor (Track B).
 *
 * The clock for `RETENTION_MANIFEST` (`retention-manifest.ts`), which is where
 * the periods and the reasons for them live. This file only knows HOW to apply
 * one, and deliberately knows nothing about which number applies to what.
 *
 * ── Why this is not in `retention-sweep.ts` ─────────────────────────────────
 * That module is the AGREEMENT clock: per-tenant windows, a `purged_at`
 * destruction marker, a signature to destroy. This one is platform-fixed
 * windows over log tables with no marker column and no tenant dimension. They
 * share a cron tick and nothing else, and merging them would put two different
 * definitions of "due" in one function.
 *
 * There is a second, sharper reason. `erasure-manifest-coverage.spec.ts` reads
 * `retention-sweep.ts` by pinned path and asserts it does not mention
 * `inspections` — the tripwire that keeps the property-address family's
 * "NOT YET ENFORCED" notice honest. Growing that file for unrelated work is how
 * a tripwire ends up widened for a reason that has nothing to do with what it
 * guards. Nothing here references `inspections`, and nothing here should.
 *
 * ── Anonymize reuses the shared SET, and layers on the retention delta ──────
 * `ANONYMIZE_AUDIT_PII` is the same mapping the erasure orchestrator applies,
 * so a row erased then swept and a row swept then erased land byte-identical on
 * the columns both paths touch. The retention path additionally clears the
 * ACTOR columns, which the DSAR path deliberately keeps — see the comment on
 * `ANONYMIZE_AUDIT_ACTOR` below. That delta is layered at this call site rather
 * than pushed into the shared module, exactly as `retention-sweep.ts` layers
 * `signature_base64` on top of the shared signer SET.
 *
 * ── Idempotent, count-only ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every statement carries a predicate that stops matching once it has run, so a
 * second pass reports zero rather than re-reporting the same work. A cron that
 * logs phantom purges is worse than one that logs nothing, because somebody
 * will eventually chart it. Summaries carry counts and table names only — never
 * a row, never a value.
