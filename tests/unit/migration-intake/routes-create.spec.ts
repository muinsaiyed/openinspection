/**
 * Turning an upload into a batch.
 *
 * Three things are decided here and nowhere else: whether this person may run
 * THIS import (per intent, reusing the gates the rest of the product already
 * enforces), whether anything can read the file, and — when nothing can —
 * whether there is anybody to hand it to.
 *
 * Where there is not, the file is refused BEFORE it is stored. Keeping a third
 * party's personal data that we could do nothing with has no reason behind it,
 * and "we might add an adapter later" is not one.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY refusal here is asserted on its OWN sentence, not on its status
 * code. Four different guards on this one route answer 400, and three answer
 * 403/422 in pairs — a spec that asserted the code alone would have passed with
 * any one of them wired to the wrong branch. Each refusal is paired with a
 * positive control: the same request with the single blocking condition removed.
