/**
 * The import-run routes as SHAPES — method, path, role floor, and what each one
 * answers with. No behaviour.
 *
 * Split from server/api/migration-intake.ts as pure movement, the same way
 * repair-builder/crud-routes.ts is split from repair-builder.ts. The handlers
 * stay chained onto the single router in the parent module, so every path,
 * method and the exported `MigrationIntakeApi` type are unchanged — and, more
 * to the point, the per-intent gate the handlers share stays module-private
 * over there rather than becoming an export that anything could reach.
 *
 * Nine routes, one prefix: a run can carry templates, contacts or team members,
 * so filing any of them under a per-entity prefix would hide it from readers of
 * the other two.
