/**
 * A preservation obligation that outranks every scheduled deletion.
 *
 * This is a GLOBAL invariant rather than a per-table note:
 * a record within the scope of a legal hold, dispute, regulatory investigation
 * or DSAR/complaint preservation must not be removed by an ordinary retention
 * sweep until the hold is released. Without it, every window in
 * `retention-manifest.ts` is a promise the first preservation request breaks —
 * the numbers stop being a governance choice and become an upper bound the
 * platform enforces against its own legal interest.
 *
 * ── A hold covers a tenant, not a row ───────────────────────────────────────
 * There is no scope column, and that is a decision rather than a first cut.
 * A narrow hold has to enumerate what it covers BEFORE anyone knows what the
 * matter will turn out to need, and every record it failed to name gets deleted
 * on schedule while a hold is nominally in force — which is the worst of the
 * available outcomes, because the hold's existence is what makes the deletion
 * look considered. Widening later is additive and safe; discovering a gap after
 * the sweep ran is not. Over-preservation under a recorded hold is a defensible
 * posture; under-preservation is spoliation.
 *
 * ── Released, not deleted ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `releasedAt` is nullable and a released row STAYS. A boolean, or a delete,
 * would leave no way to answer the question that actually gets asked later:
 * over which period was this tenant's data preserved, and who decided it no
 * longer had to be. The hold is itself a record about a legal matter, so this
 * table appears in `retention-out-of-scope` — a hold that expired on its own
 * schedule would be a preservation record that failed to preserve itself.
 *
 * ── Why `matter` is NOT NULL ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A hold with no matter reference can be placed but never responsibly released:
 * the person deciding whether it still applies has nothing to check it against,
 * so the safe answer is always "leave it", and the platform accumulates holds
 * nobody can retire. Requiring the reference at placement is what keeps release
 * a decision rather than a guess.
