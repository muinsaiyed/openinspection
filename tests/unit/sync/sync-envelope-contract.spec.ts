/**
 * The control on the suite above.
 *
 * Every assertion in `sync envelope contract` is driven by `CASES`, a list
 * maintained by hand, so the suite can only ever be as complete as somebody
 * remembered to make it — and for `tenant.compliance_status_updated` nobody did.
 * That event was registered nowhere, fixtured nowhere, and emitted with a name
 * that could not survive `toCloudEvent`; the suite stayed green throughout,
 * because a type absent from `CASES` is a type it never looks at.
 *
 * A green suite over an unknown fraction of the registry is not a measurement.
 * These two tests print the other number: the registry's size, against the set
 * `CASES` actually covers. Adding an event type to `SCHEMAS` without a golden
 * fixture is now a red build, and the failure NAMES the type rather than
 * reporting a count.
