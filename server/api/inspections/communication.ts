/**
 * GET /api/inspections/:id/communication — the Communication section's payload
 * (Communication design §2, plan A1.1/A1.2).
 *
 * Two arrays, deliberately NOT merged: **messages** (written by a person) and
 * **deliveries** (sent by the platform). The UI never interleaves them, so
 * merging server-side only to split again client-side invites the merged
 * rendering back.
 *
 * A third array joined them for OI #271: **reportLinks**, the per-recipient
 * answer to "did the report reach them, and did they open it". It is not a
 * fourth grammar — it is the SUMMARY of the delivery question the Outbox rows
 * below it answer in detail, which is why it rides this payload rather than
 * costing the hub loader another round trip. Its shape and the reasoning behind
 * its three states live in `server/lib/report-view-status.ts`.
 *
 * This endpoint superseded `GET /api/automations/logs/{inspectionId}` — a fully
 * defined route that never had a caller. Money redaction does not apply (no
 * money in this payload); recipient emails and phones DO go over the wire,
 * which is exactly what the `viewCommunication` capability exists to gate
 * (design §6 Q3, resolved) — role gate first, capability layered on top.
