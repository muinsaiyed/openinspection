/**
 * Workspace (authenticated) responsive smoke.
 *
 * `public-pages-responsive.spec.ts` has asserted "no horizontal scroll at any
 * viewport" since Sprint 1 — but only for /book and /not-found. Every page an
 * inspector actually spends the day in (Contacts, Team, Invoices, Inspections,
 * Settings) had NO responsive coverage at all.
 *
 * That gap is not theoretical. `auth-layout.tsx` carried `flex-1 w-full` on
 * <main>: a flex child asking for 100% of a row that already contains the
 * sidebar. It made the content column 1080px inside a 1245px viewport and
 * scrolled EVERY workspace page sideways — undetected, because the rule was
 * only ever enforced against three public pages.
 *
 * Same viewport matrix and same assertion as the public spec, deliberately.
 * 1100px carries the most weight: per that spec's own note, iPad Pro 11"
 * landscape (1180px) is the inspector's field device.
 *
 * A wide TABLE inside a page is fine and expected — Contacts has eight
 * columns and cannot show them all on a phone. What must not happen is the
 * PAGE scrolling: a table scrolls within its own container (shared-ui Table
 * wraps itself in `overflow-x-auto`), which keeps the page compliant while
 * leaving the columns reachable.

/**
 * ⚠️ OPEN — `contacts @ ipad-portrait` sometimes stalls when this project runs
 * on its own (`--workers=1`); it has not been seen to stall in the full suite at
 * `workers: 3`.
 *
 * ── CORRECTION (2026-08-21): INTERMITTENT, not deterministic ────────────────
 * This note used to open with "fails deterministically … verified 2026-08-05
 * across eight runs". That sentence is WITHDRAWN, and kept visible here because
 * it is the claim a reader is most likely to arrive holding. What actually
 * happened: it reproduced 4/4 inside one ~20-minute window, and then passed 6
 * consecutive times on a byte-identical tree, with no controlled variable
 * explaining where the boundary between those two stretches fell. So a green
 * run is not evidence that it is fixed, and a red run is not evidence that a
 * change caused it. Anything written here — or in a commit message — that
 * asserts determinism about this failure is wrong.
 *
 * The failure is always the FIRST test in the matrix, never any of the other 49
 * that issue the identical `beforeEach` navigation: `page.goto('/login')` never
 * completes, the test timeout expires, and Playwright tears the page down —
 * reported as `net::ERR_ABORTED; maybe frame was detached`, which looks like a
 * navigation bug and is really the teardown.
 *
 * ── CORRECTION: NO TIMEOUT CAN EVER HELP, and the arithmetic says why ───────
 * The stall length EQUALS the test timeout — it does not merely exceed it:
 *
 *   default 30s      → the request eventually logged `200 OK (37007ms)`
 *   --timeout=120000 → the same request logged `200 OK (128053ms)`
 *
 * The queued request is released when the CLIENT disconnects (~7–8s after the
 * timeout fires, which matches `browserContext.close`), not by any server-side
 * progress. Raising the timeout therefore RAISES the stall; it can never outrun
 * it. Anyone reaching for a bigger budget here is buying a longer red run.
 *
 * ── Where the 30s actually goes (recorded so nobody re-derives it) ──────────
 * Between miniflare's entry worker and the user worker. Miniflare timestamps
 * the request in immediately, the application handles it in ~5ms once it
 * arrives, and the whole gap is workerd not delivering the request on that one
 * connection. That is why the ruled-out list below reads as complete in the
 * direction it was pointing: application code, Playwright hook semantics and
 * cold start are all out, because none of them is running during the stall.
 *
 * Ruled out by experiment, each with its own run — none of these is the cause:
 *   - slowness / cold start: a 90s budget times out the same way (and, per the
 *     equality above, that is exactly what a bigger budget must do)
 *   - `waitUntil: 'load'` hanging on a subresource: `domcontentloaded` identical
 *   - the worker not being up: /status answers before the hook runs
 *   - retrying the goto: the test timeout kills the hook, so the catch is dead
 *   - warming the API in beforeAll (`request.get`), and warming the browser in
 *     beforeAll with a separate page — neither changes the outcome
 *
 * It is a harness fault, not a product one: the page it cannot reach is served
 * to the 49 navigations that follow it. NOT quarantined with `fixme`, because
 * skipping it only promotes the next test into the same position — which would
 * hide the fault rather than remove it.
