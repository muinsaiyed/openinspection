/**
 * How long a rendered report PDF is kept.
 *
 * A platform DEFAULT, not a legal requirement, and the difference is the whole
 * point of this file existing rather than a bare constant.
 *
 * ── What was struck, and why it matters here ────────────────────────────────
 * This repository used to derive seven years as "5 + 2": Illinois requires five
 * years for home-inspection contracts, reports and supporting data, plus two
 * years past final disposition of a qualifying judicial proceeding. That
 * derivation was REJECTED and has been withdrawn. Illinois is
 * five years OR two years past final disposition, WHICHEVER IS LONGER — the
 * second figure is an event-dependent tail, not a fixed cap, and a proceeding
 * ending in year six extends the statutory period past seven. So seven years
 * cannot be presented as the longest statutory period, and a register row
 * reading `P7Y — legal basis = Illinois law` invites the next reader to
 * conclude that a California tenant is legally required to keep seven years.
 *
 * The number survived. The reasoning did not, and the reasoning is what the
 * settings screen shows a customer.
 *
 * ── Zero means indefinite ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * That is an explicit controller instruction, which the
 * platform executes. It is not the default and it is not us declining to have
 * one. The dominant competitor stores reports indefinitely including after
 * cancellation, so our having a default at all runs against what an inspection
 * company expects — which is exactly why it is disclosed at the point of
 * setting rather than on a policy page.
 *
 * ── What this module does NOT decide ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Tenant override is not absolute: the effective period is
 * `jurisdictional minimum + tenant instruction + platform constraints`, never
 * `tenant choice > law`. This function answers only the middle term — what the
 * tenant asked for, or the default when they have not asked. A jurisdictional
 * floor, once we can determine one per tenant, is applied above this and not
 * folded into it; folding it in here would make one function silently
 * responsible for a legal determination it has no facts for.
