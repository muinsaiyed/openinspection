/**
 * One door for the agent terms, in front of all three ways into an agent
 * session.
 *
 * An agent is a third party: they are not the operator, not the operator's
 * staff, and not the client. There is a document written for them and the rule
 * is that they accept it before they use the product — not before they REGISTER,
 * which is a narrower rule that the shape of this system does not satisfy.
 * There are three ways to hold an agent session:
 *
 *   1. signup            `POST /api/agent-signup`      — records the acceptance
 *   2. password login    `POST /api/agent/login`       — for an account that exists
 *   3. emailed link      `GET  /agent/magic-login`     — for an account that exists
 *
 * Only the first passes through a screen that can collect an acceptance. Two and
 * three mint a 24-hour cookie for an account that already exists and ask it
 * nothing, so a checkbox on the signup form leaves both of them open. The check
 * therefore lives after the three paths converge — on the authenticated request,
 * keyed on the ACTOR rather than on any list of routes.
 *
 * ── Why keyed on the actor, and why that is the un-skippable position ────────
 * Mounted on `*` and gated on `c.var.agentUserId`, which only the JWT middleware
 * sets and only for a verified agent token. A new agent route added next year is
 * behind this without anyone remembering, because there is no route list to
 * forget to update. The cost of that choice is that the exemptions below must be
 * exact and few, and they are.
 *
 * ── Four states, not a boolean ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `agentTermsStatus` answers with one of `ACCEPTED`, `NOT_IN_FORCE`, `REQUIRED`
 * or `UNREADABLE`, and this file switches on all four by name. Two of them pass
 * and they are NOT the same event: `ACCEPTED` is an agent bound by a document,
 * `NOT_IN_FORCE` is a deployment with no document to be bound by. They used to
 * share one `satisfied: true`, which is exactly the shape in which "this control
 * is not configured" reads as "this control is green".
 *
 * ── Fail closed ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A registry that cannot be read refuses, as its own state (`UNREADABLE`) and
 * never as `NOT_IN_FORCE`. Passing on an unreadable registry would mean the gate
 * is off precisely when nobody is watching, and an agent with no acceptance is
 * an account that should not have existed — letting it through is the original
 * defect happening again, quietly. `agentTermsStatus` owns that decision,
 * including the one case that is deliberately NOT a refusal (a deployment that
 * has published no agent terms has none for anyone to accept, and cannot gain a
 * new agent either); its doc comment carries the argument.
 *
 * ── What is exempt, and the principle that decides it ───────────────────────
 * A gate with no way out is a lockout, so the way out is exempt: the page that
 * shows the text and the endpoint that records the acceptance.
 *
 * The list below is short and exact, but it is a consequence, not the rule. The
 * rule, so the next person reasons instead of consulting a list:
 *
 *   The Agent Terms gate may restrict access to functionality whose use
 *   requires the agent to be bound by the Agent Terms, but it must not
 *   condition account exit or applicable privacy-rights mechanisms on
 *   acceptance of those terms.
 *
 * Both halves matter. Account exit is the first: a gate whose only exits are
 * "agree" and "keep an account you no longer want" is coercion. Privacy-rights
 * mechanisms are the second, and they are a separate test rather than a special
 * case of the first — a data export is not an exit, the agent may well intend to
 * stay, and access to their own data is not something they can be made to buy
 * with a signature. Anything ADDED here in future has to answer that rule out
 * loud; anything that fails it does not need a new entry, it needs the entry it
 * is missing.
 *
 * Answering it out loud is now the only way to add a route. Every agent-reachable
 * path carries a row in `agent-terms-routes.ts` with its answer in prose, the
 * exempt list below is derived from the rows that answer no, and
 * `scripts/check-agent-terms-classification.mjs` fails the commit on a route
 * with no row at all. The rule stopped being something a reader had to remember
 * to apply.
 *
 * The report-token track needs no entry here and that is structural, not lucky.
 * A client or agent opening a report link presents an `inspection_access_tokens`
 * bearer, not a session; the JWT middleware short-circuits those paths before
 * classifying anyone, so `agentUserId` is unset and this middleware returns
 * immediately. `tests/unit/legal/agent-terms-gate.spec.ts` pins that, because
 * gating a homebuyer's report link would be a customer-facing outage caused by
 * an agent-only rule.

 * exemption list spells "we decided this route is gated" and "nobody has looked
 * at this route" identically, as absence, and the second one is the failure this
 * mechanism exists to prevent. The gate script refuses a route with no row, so
 * the question gets asked at the moment it is cheap to answer.
 *
 * Exact, and not a prefix, for the reason the JWT middleware beside this one
 * learned the hard way: `path === '/api/agent-signup'` does not cover
 * `/api/agent-signup/terms`, and the fix was to list the child rather than to
 * loosen the match. A prefix here would exempt every future path underneath it,
 * which for `/api/agent` would be the whole agent API.
