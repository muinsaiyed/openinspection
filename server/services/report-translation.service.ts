/**
 * Storage for courtesy translations, and the one rule that decides whether a
 * stored one may be shown.
 *
 * The rule is a comparison of two hashes and it is stated in the schema
 * (`server/lib/db/schema/report-translation.ts`) rather than here, because it
 * is a property of the column and not of this class. Read it before changing
 * either method below: the match and the mismatch do not prove symmetric
 * things, and the asymmetry is what makes withholding safe.
 *
 * WHY TWO READS. `read` returns the record whatever its hash; `readFresh`
 * returns it only when the report it is read against still hashes to the
 * English it was made from. Client-facing surfaces call the second. The first
 * exists because "no translation" and "a translation, currently withheld" are
 * different answers to the person who can repair the second one, and a single
 * method returning null for both would erase that distinction at every call
 * site at once.
 *
 * ⚠️ Nothing here reads a tenant setting, and that is an invariant rather than
 * an omission. Turning the feature off must not alter a single already
 * published report: the reader path answers from stored rows only, so a
 * settings change can stop new translations being produced and can never strip
 * one from a document already delivered.
