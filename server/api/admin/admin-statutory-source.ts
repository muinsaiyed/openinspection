// Admin → the authority's own PDF for one published revision.
//
// A statutory form is rendered onto the issuing agency's document, and that
// document is not carried in this repository: it is the agency's, and a field
// map is authored against one revision's exact bytes. Nothing wrote those bytes
// to storage, so a deployment could install a statutory package and then fail to
// produce anything from it -- "installed" and "usable" quietly meaning different
// things, which is among the hardest classes of fault to trace.
//
// This is that missing step, and it is a person's step. See
// services/statutory/source-upload.ts for why the bytes are not fetched on the
// operator's behalf.
//
// ── WHY THE REVISION TRAVELS IN THE BODY, NOT THE PATH ──────────────────────
// Revision labels are the authority's own, verbatim, and they contain slashes
// (`Rev. 04/26`). A percent-encoded slash in a path segment is normalised by
// intermediaries and by more than one router, so the label would arrive split or
// mangled exactly for the forms most likely to need it. It is a form field.
//
// ── WHY `owner` AND NOT A PLATFORM GUARD ────────────────────────────────────
// In a self-hosted deployment the operator IS the workspace owner, and there is
// no platform to ask. Widening the shared `_platform/` key to a workspace role
// is safe here specifically because of the hash: the recorded sha256 admits
// exactly one sequence of bytes, so the most a caller can do is write the
// authority's real document over itself. Nothing else about this key is
// writable from a workspace, and the cross-tenant admin reads (who is on which
// revision, what a withdrawal affects) deliberately live elsewhere, behind the
// M2M guard -- see server/portal/statutory-admin.routes.ts.

/**
 * What an operator has to see BEFORE they can upload anything.
 *
 * The upload below takes a revision label the caller already knows. Nobody
 * knows one: the labels are the authority's own, they contain characters a URL
 * mangles, and which of them this build publishes is decided by what is
 * compiled in. Without this read the only way to reach the upload was to open
 * the source and copy a string out of it, which is not a product.
 *
 * It answers presence too, because "which revisions exist" and "which of them
 * can actually render" are the same question asked one step apart, and a screen
 * that had to join two responses to show one row would be a screen that shows
 * the join wrong on the day one call fails.
