/**
 * A request to correct a field of a record that has already been delivered.
 *
 * ── Why the list is this short, and why the client's NAME is not on it ──────
 * Publishing a report freezes the `inspections` row into a signed, hash-chained
 * snapshot (`ReportVersionService.snapshotOnPublish`). Anything inside that
 * snapshot is a copy that no later edit can reach, which is exactly why
 * correcting it needs a new version. Anything OUTSIDE it is resolved live on
 * every read and corrects itself the moment the source row changes.
 *
 * The people on an inspection are the second kind: `inspections` carries no
 * client columns at all any more (they were dropped in favour of
 * `inspection_people` → `contacts`), and every reader joins the contact at read
 * time. Correcting a contact's name therefore reaches every surface already,
 * and routing it through an amendment would publish a new version that differs
 * from its predecessor in nothing.
 *
 * So this enum holds the record's own frozen fields. Adding to it is a
 * decision: a field belongs here when, and only when, it is inside the
 * snapshot.
