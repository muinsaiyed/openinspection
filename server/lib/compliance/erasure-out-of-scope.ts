 * reason. Split out of the manifest when that file reached its anti-monolith
 * line cap — the two arrays are read together and mean nothing apart, so the
 * gate concatenates both sources before parsing either. Add a column here only
 * with a reason that says why it cannot carry a data subject's data; an entry
 * without one is a shrug that reads like a decision.
 */

/**
 * A PII-heuristic column the manifest DELIBERATELY does not act on. Every entry
 * must say why — the reason is what a DSAR audit reads, and the CI gate
 * (`scripts/check-erasure-manifest.mjs`) hard-fails an entry without one.
 *
 * @gateConsumed `scripts/check-erasure-manifest.mjs` reads this declaration out
 * of the SOURCE TEXT (`arrayBody(src, 'ERASURE_OUT_OF_SCOPE')`) rather than
 * importing it — the gate is a plain .mjs script and the manifest is TypeScript.
 * That consumption is invisible to a module-graph analyzer, so knip would report
 * both symbols as dead. The tag (knip `tags: ["-gateConsumed"]`) says "a tool
 * consumes this", which is true; a dead-code baseline entry would have said
 * "this is dead and we tolerate it", which is not.
