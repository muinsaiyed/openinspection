/**
 * `GET /api/platform/migration-runs/:batchId/source`
 *
 * Hands a workspace's uploaded import file to the person at the deployment
 * operator who is going to convert it — and writes down that they did.
 *
 * WHY THIS ROUTE EXISTS AT ALL
 * ----------------------------
 * Assisted imports were already possible: the operator authorises staff access,
 * somebody opens the file, somebody delivers a converted bundle back. What was
 * missing is the middle step. `staff-access.ts` names the gap in its own words —
 * the rule it enforces "cannot prevent a file from having been opened — that
 * happens in object storage, where no code of ours is watching." Opening it here
 * puts code of ours in that path, once, at the only moment where the file, the
 * authorisation and the person acting are all in hand at the same time.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT TENANT-SCOPED FROM THE REQUEST, and it must not be. The caller is the
 * operator's own console, which spans workspaces; the run's `tenant_id` comes
 * off the row and is what the audit is filed under. What stands in for a session
 * here is the M2M signature plus the two checks below, and nothing about the
 * request is trusted except the batch id it names.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE AUDIT WRITE IS AWAITED, AND ITS FAILURE FAILS THE REQUEST. That is a
 * deliberate departure from the house pattern: `auditFromContext` is
 * fire-and-forget precisely so that recording an event can never turn a request
 * that DID happen into a 500, which is right for almost everything. It is wrong
 * here. A download served with no row is exactly the state this route was built
 * to make impossible, so the row goes first and the bytes only follow if it
 * landed. Anyone tempted to "fix" this back to `waitUntil` is restoring the
 * defect.
