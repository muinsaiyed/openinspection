/**
 * §4 says the screen must let a reader answer two questions without help:
 * *what will you send me* and *what can I stop*. These assert the answers.
 *
 * Three surfaces render this model. The reason it is one function is that the
 * filtering — audience, recipient-facing, which channels a class can even use —
 * would otherwise be decided three times, and a class added later would appear
 * on two screens out of three with nothing to say which was right.
