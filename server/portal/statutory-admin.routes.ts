/**
 * The platform admin surface for statutory forms.
 *
 * ── WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT UNDER /api/admin ──────────────────────────────
 * Every answer below spans workspaces: how many installed a package, how many
 * documents went out on a revision, and whether a catalogue entry is offered at
 * all. None of that is a workspace's business, and there is no role on a
 * workspace token that should carry it — an owner asking how many other
 * companies are on revision 7-6 is a cross-tenant read wearing an admin hat.
 *
 * So the guard is `requireServiceBinding`, the same MAC over the shared keyring
 * that every other portal→core route uses, and it is a MAC rather than a role
 * on purpose: claiming to be the platform costs the key.
 *
 * ── WHAT A SELF-HOSTED DEPLOYMENT DOES INSTEAD ──────────────────────────────
 * `/api/platform/*` is 404 unless `APP_MODE=saas` (see workers/app.ts), so
 * these routes do not exist in a standalone build. That is the right shape and
 * not a gap: a standalone deployment has one workspace, so "who else is on this
 * revision" has no plural to answer, and its operator holds the database and
 * the catalogue source directly. The one statutory admin action a self-hosted
 * operator genuinely needs — supplying the authority's PDF — is a workspace
 * route (`server/api/admin/admin-statutory-source.ts`) precisely because there
 * is no platform on the other end of it.
 *
 * ── NO AUDIT ROW, DELIBERATELY ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `audit_logs` is tenant-scoped and every row carries a tenant_id. A delisting
 * belongs to no tenant, so filing it against one would put a platform action in
 * some workspace's own history, where it would read as something that workspace
 * did. It is logged instead, with the actor the signed header carried.
