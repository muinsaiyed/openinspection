/**
 * How long a rendered report PDF is kept, and who chose the number.
 *
 * The number stands; its old reasoning does not. The
 * "5 + 2 = 7" derivation this repository used to carry was
 * REJECTED: Illinois is five years OR two years past
 * final disposition of a qualifying proceeding, WHICHEVER IS LONGER, so the
 * second figure is an event-dependent tail rather than a fixed cap, and a
 * proceeding ending in year six pushes the statutory period past seven. Seven
 * years therefore cannot be presented as "the longest statutory period".
 *
 * What that means for code, and why it is tested rather than commented: the
 * default has to be machine-readably marked as a platform choice, so a later
 * reader — or a settings screen, or an export of the retention register —
 * cannot restate it as a legal requirement.
