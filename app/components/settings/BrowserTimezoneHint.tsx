 * detect the viewer's zone instead of defaulting silently to UTC; this offers
 * the detected zone as a one-click choice without ever changing what the picker
 * resolves to on its own.
 *
 * SSR-safe: the browser zone is read AFTER mount (initial render is null on both
 * server and client), so there is no hydration mismatch. The line only appears
 * when the detected zone differs from what's already in effect — an actionable
 * suggestion, not decoration.
