/**
 * Which provider events become OI busy time — the Spectora one-off semantics.
 *
 * Pure decision logic on purpose. The orchestration (credentials, read set,
 * persistence) lives in `sync-engine.ts`; everything that is a RULE lives here,
 * where it can be tested without a database or a network.
 *
 * The rules, in the order they are applied:
 *
 *  2. Skip events OI itself pushed. Without this the calendar round-trips: we
 *     write an inspection to Google, read it back as "busy", and the inspector
 *     then appears unavailable for the job they are booked on. The link table
 *     is what makes an event recognisable as ours.
 *  3. Skip instances of a recurring series. `singleEvents=true` expands series
 *     into instances, so a weekly standup arrives as fifty separate busy
 *     blocks. Spectora imports one-off appointments only, and so do we in v1.
 *  6. Skip events that predate the connection. Connecting a calendar should not
 *     retroactively block months of already-accepted work. An event is "new
 *     enough" if EITHER its creation or its last modification is at/after
 *     connect — an old event moved into the window is a real change.
 *
 * Rules 4 and 5 (keyed upsert, delete-in-range) are not here: they already
 * shipped inside `syncProviderBusyOverrides`.
 *
 * Blocks with no `externalId` come from the freeBusy endpoint, which reports
 * anonymous ranges. None of these rules can be evaluated against them, so they
 * are kept as-is — the coarse fallback stays coarse rather than silently
 * dropping to nothing.
