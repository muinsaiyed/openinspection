 * #275 — the string-keyed seams that carry the action tag from a form to the API.
 *
 * `form.get("repairActionTag")` on one side, `fd.append("repairActionTag", …)` on
 * the other, and nothing type-checks the pair: a field the route does not parse
 * is written as null on that path while the page still renders and still saves.
 *
 * The builder route action has TWO branches that must each read the key —
 * add-item and update-item — and the agent bulk-add posts a third, entirely
 * separate explicit field list. Three seams, three tests. The trade assertion in
 * the agent test is not incidental: `trade` was missing from that list from
 * IA-57 until #275, so every agent-forwarded list had a null trade snapshot.

/**
 * Why the mocks and the route imports are hoisted to module scope (#88).
 *
 * These specs reach the route actions through a dynamic `import()` of the route
 * MODULE, so whoever runs first pays for that module's entire import graph —
 * and the graph reaches `~/paraglide/messages`, which is ~3.7 MB of generated
 * source re-exporting a ~1.3 MB bundle per locale. Vite transforms that on the
 * ONE main thread every test worker shares, so under a loaded suite the cost is
 * queueing behind other workers, not compute. Two things then made it fatal:
 * the wait landed inside an `it()`, where it is billed against the 5 s default
 * test timeout, and an `afterEach(vi.resetModules)` made all five tests re-walk
 * the graph instead of one.
 *
 * Measured here: the first test took 3.6 s alone, and crossed 5 s whenever the
 * rest of the suite competed for the transform server — a red test for reasons
 * with nothing to do with what it asserts. It read as a flake because the victim
 * moved: whichever spec demands the transform first while the workers are all
 * starting is the one that draws the short straw.
 *
 * So the graph is loaded ONCE, in `beforeAll`, where loading a fixture belongs
 * and where the budget is the hook timeout rather than a test's. That is only
 * possible because the mocks below are module-scoped and merely re-armed
 * between tests, so no test needs its own module registry.
 *
 * `m` is stubbed for the same reason: nothing on an action path reads a message.
 * It is touched by `meta()` and by section JSX, neither of which these specs
 * render, so the biggest thing in the graph is also the least relevant one.
