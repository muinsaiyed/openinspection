/**
 * Proof that the Price Capability Inventory gate
 * (`scripts/check-price-capability.mjs`) bites.
 *
 * The product decision it enforces: the platform stores what an inspection
 * OBSERVES — category, severity, description — and never produces a repair
 * cost, a market value, or a negotiation amount. Money on an inspection is
 * written by the buyer or their agent.
 *
 * A gate is only worth its runtime if somebody has watched it go red on the
 * thing it exists to stop, and the sharpest available material is the pair of
 * columns that were deleted when this rule was adopted: `estimateMinCents` /
 * `estimateMaxCents`, a repair estimate on a canned comment that reached the
 * report as the inspection company's own figure. The fixture puts them back;
 * this spec asserts the gate says so.
 *
 * It runs the gate as a child process rather than importing it, because the
 * exit code IS the contract — a gate that prints complaints and exits 0 is the
 * failure mode this whole family of checks was written after.
