/**
 * Money going back out.
 *
 * Both refund writers live here, together, on purpose. They were about to be
 * split across two files — `markRefunded` where the ledger already was, and
 * the partial next to its caller — and two writers of the same concept in two
 * places is the shape where one of them gets the next fix and the other
 * quietly does not. There is exactly one place to look for "how does this
 * product refund".
 *
 * The house rules both obey:
 *
 *  - **Append, never rewrite.** A refund is a `refund`-kind ROW. The invoice's
 *    derived columns are recomputed from the ledger by its single writer.
 *  - **Re-sync the report gate.** `inspections.payment_status = 'paid'` is a
 *    CACHE of "some unvoided invoice on this inspection is paid", and a refund
 *    can falsify it. Skipping the re-sync leaves a report publicly readable
 *    with no backing payment, and no test that ignores `inspections` notices.
 *  - **Return the row.** All three writers answer with the appended row rather
 *    than void, because an external book of record has to key its credit memo
 *    on the ROW id: `qbo_entity_map` is uniquely indexed on
 *    (tenant, type, oiId) and can hold exactly one credit memo per invoice
 *    forever, so keying on the invoice makes a second refund throw INSIDE the
 *    push — the memo lands in QuickBooks and the map row is lost. Per-row
 *    identity is the only shape that survives a second refund.
 *  - **Push from the SEAM, never from here.** This module is pure DB: no QBO
 *    service, no `env`, no `executionCtx` — the same reason the payment push
 *    does not live in `payment-ledger.service`. Firing a QuickBooks call from a
 *    writer would mean injecting a callback into every caller AND awaiting an
 *    outbound HTTP request inside the refund's own path, where a QuickBooks
 *    outage could fail a refund the tenant already granted. The push belongs
 *    where `executionCtx.waitUntil` exists, which is the route: today that is
 *    `POST /api/inspections/{id}/cancel`, the single production entry to all of
 *    this via `applyCancellationRefund`. A new writer therefore has to be given
 *    a seam before it can move money, and that is the point — it is a visible
 *    step, not a silently missing one.

/**
 * Send back money held against an ORDER that has no invoice — a booking

 *
 * A THIRD writer, and the reason it is not a flag on `refundPartial`: that
 * function's body is "load the invoice, seed its ledger from its own record,
 * check what IT received, append against it, recompute ITS cache". Four of
 * those five steps have no meaning without an invoice. Passing `invoiceId:
 * null` through it would put two different functions behind one name, and the
 * one that skipped the guards would be the one handling money nobody has
 * billed for yet.
 *
 * WHAT IS ABSENT HERE, deliberately:
 *
 *  - No `recomputeInvoicePaymentState`. There is no invoice cache to refresh;
 *    the held total is derived from the rows every time it is read.
 *  - No `seedLedgerFromInvoiceRecord`. A held deposit exists only as ledger
 *    rows — there is no older column-shaped record it could be reconstructed
 *    from, so there is nothing to seed.
 *
 * The gate re-sync IS kept, even though a held deposit never set the gate:
 * `payment_status = 'paid'` flips only on a paid invoice, so this cannot
 * falsify it. Keeping the call means the house rule at the top of this file
 * holds for every writer without exception, which is cheaper to trust than an
 * exception someone has to re-derive.

 * nothing to reverse. It returned void until the QuickBooks refund push landed,
 * which is when "return the row" stopped being a style rule: NOT returning it
 * is what forces the next person to key a credit memo on the invoice id, and
 * that is a memo QuickBooks accepts and `qbo_entity_map` then refuses to
 * record. This function has no production caller today, so it pushes NOTHING —
