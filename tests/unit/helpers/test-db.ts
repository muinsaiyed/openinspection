/**
 * Shared typed fixture for the ONE type mismatch every `tests/unit/` spec hits.
 *
 * The suite runs business logic against a real in-memory SQLite database
 * (`tests/unit/db.ts` → `drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3`), but the production code
 * it exercises is typed against D1 (`drizzle-orm/d1`). Those two Drizzle
 * instances are structurally identical for everything a service actually calls
 * — `select` / `insert` / `update` / `delete` / `run` / `all` / `get` share one
 * query-builder implementation and one dialect surface. They differ in exactly
 * one member: D1 exposes `batch()` (D1's `db.batch()` transaction primitive),
 * which better-sqlite3 has no analogue for.
 *
 * So the mismatch is real but narrow, and it cannot be typed away from the test
 * side: the callee signatures live under `server/` and correctly say D1. Rather
 * than let ~40 specs each reach for their own `as any` / `as never` at the call
 * site — which is how a genuine shape error hides among the noise — the cast
 * lives here, once, named, with the reason attached.
 *
 * ⚠️ USE ONLY FOR CODE PATHS THAT DO NOT CALL `batch()`. If a service under test
 * starts batching, this fixture will type-check and then fail at runtime with
 * `db.batch is not a function` — that is the honest signal to give that spec a
 * real D1 stub instead of widening this.
