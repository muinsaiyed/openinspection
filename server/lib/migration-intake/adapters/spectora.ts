/**
 * The Spectora export button's file, converted to the v2 schema.
 *
 * ── What the export actually is ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A spreadsheet. One row per canned comment, 42 columns wide, with the section
 * and the item repeated on every row — so the structure is implied by repeated
 * values rather than nested. A real export measured 1873 rows: one header and
 * 1872 comments, resolving to 16 sections and 90 items.
 *
 * ⚠️ 90, not the 76 this comment said until 2026-08-24. 76 is how many distinct
 * item NAMES that file uses; four of them appear under more than one section,
 * one of them under eleven. Grouping keys on section-and-item together (see
 * `itemKey` below), so 90 is what this adapter actually produces — which means
 * an operator importing that file sees 90 and the number to sanity-check
 * against is this one. Both counts are true of the file; only one describes the
 * structure, and the wrong one had been written down twice.
 *
 * This adapter used to read a JSON object with a `sections` array and describe
 * a four-bucket comment model. That representation exists, but it is not what
 * the export button produces, and the four buckets are not what the file marks:
 * every row carries `info`, `limit` or `defect`, which are already our three
 * comment tabs. The mapping that was made complicated is the identity. The JSON
 * reader that served the retired paste endpoint is gone with it; a file in that
 * shape now arrives through the same upload the export button's file does.
 *
 * ── Purity ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Ids are derived from a row's POSITION in the file, never minted. The same
 * bytes therefore convert to the same bundle, which is what lets a re-map
 * re-read a stored file and compare the result against what was staged.
