/**
 * How big a problem one revision is, when the revision turns out to be a
 * problem.
 *
 * ── THE QUESTION A RECALL ACTUALLY STARTS WITH ──────────────────────────────
 * Two faults end here, and they are not the same fault: our field map was found
 * to be wrong, or the authority withdrew the revision. What a workspace is told
 * differs. What a platform operator needs first is identical, and it is a
 * number: how many official documents were produced from this revision, and by
 * whom. Everything after that — whether to withdraw, what to write, how urgent
 * it is — is a judgement made on top of that number.
 *
 * ── WHY IT COUNTS DOCUMENTS, NOT INSPECTIONS ────────────────────────────────
 * A re-issue is a second delivery: the same inspection can have put two copies
 * of the same wrong document into two different sets of hands. Counting
 * inspections would report the smaller, more comfortable number, and the whole
 * point of `statutory_form_productions` — one row per production, never an
 * upsert — is that the larger one is the true one. Both are returned so the
 * difference between them is visible rather than lost in a choice.
 *
 * ── WHY IT DOES NOT READ INSTALLS ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * A workspace that has since uninstalled still produced whatever it produced.
 * Answering this from `tenant_library_imports` would omit exactly those, which
 * is the reading that looks reassuring and is wrong.
