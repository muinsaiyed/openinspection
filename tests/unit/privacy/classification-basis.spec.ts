/**
 * CA-10 and CA-11 — the two classifications that were absences, and the reason
 * each one has to travel with the classification rather than in a memory.
 *
 * The two entries:
 *  - CA-10 (`inspections.address_lat` / `address_lng`): a typed address geocoded
 *    by a places API is NOT statutory precise geolocation, because
 *    §1798.140(w) requires data "derived from a device". The recorded reading:
 *    "this is a statutory exclusion, not merely an architectural accident", and
 *    "the reason is the statutory definition, not simply 'we don't currently use
 *    GPS'". The standing architecture rule that comes with it is a trip-wire:
 *    "Do not treat device-derived location as equivalent to address geocoding."
 *  - CA-11 (`inspection_messages.body`): the SPI exclusion in
 *    §1798.140(ae)(1)(E) turns on the business being the intended recipient, so
 *    the answer is directional. The one-word form
 *    (`inspection_messages = not SPI`) was refused; the vocabulary recorded
 *    here is the prescribed one: `conditional_by_direction`, reason `statutory intended-recipient
 *    test`.
 *
 * The point of the register these tests read is that a classification carries
 * WHY it holds, so that when the reason stops being true the classification
 * visibly stops with it. Two consequences are asserted below and are the reason
 * this file exists at all:
 *
 *  1. An entry nobody has actually judged must be DISTINGUISHABLE from one
 *     that was formally reviewed, and the mix must be counted out loud. A census is
 *     checked in here; adding an entry without updating it fails, and the
 *     failure prints both numbers.
 *  2. Every invariant is paired with a fabricated positive control, because a
 *     validator that returns "no problems" for a malformed entry is exactly how
 *     an unreviewed classification comes to read as reviewed.
