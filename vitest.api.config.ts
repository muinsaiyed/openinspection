    // re-reading the measurement recorded below. It is the whole reason this
    // setting looks wrong and is not.
    // `clearMocks: true` was tried on 2026-08-08 as the first step toward
    // relaxing isolation and MEASURED WORSE: the isolated suite stayed green,
    // but under `--no-isolate` the failure count went 1218 -> 1235 and
    // `this.client.prepare is not a function` went 20 -> 213, because the fake
    // D1 client that `tests/unit/db.ts` hands to drizzle is built from mock
    // functions and gets wiped out from under it. The leakage this suite has is
    // shared MODULE STATE, not spy call history.
    // The suite is IMPORT-bound, not assertion-bound. A full run reported
    // `import 1977s` against `tests 1246s`: with the default forks pool and
    // isolation, each of the 600+ spec files gets a fresh process that rebuilds
    // the whole module graph from scratch.
    //
    // Pre-bundling collapses a dependency's many small ESM files into one, so a
    // fork pays one module fetch instead of dozens. `include` is the whole of
    // it: ONLY the specifiers listed below are pre-bundled, and `enabled: true`
    // on its own caches NOTHING. Vitest hard-sets `noDiscovery: true` on every
    // optimizer environment (`resolveOptimizerConfig`), and Vite treats
    // `noDiscovery && !include.length` as "optimizer off" outright
    // (`isDepOptimizationDisabled`) — so nothing is ever auto-discovered into
    // the list, and an empty list disables the option it appears to configure.
    // `ssr` is the correct key: `environment: 'node'` runs in Vite's ssr
    // environment, and the optimizer is applied per environment NAME. (The
    // ≤ v3 name `web` is read by nothing in v4 — see vitest.config.ts.)
    //
    // 🔴 THE LIST IS EMPTY, AND THAT IS A MEASURED RESULT, NOT AN OVERSIGHT.
    // `include: ['drizzle-orm', 'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core']` was landed and
    // reverted the same day. It worked in every way it was checked — the
    // artifact appeared in deps_ssr/ AND the poison test proved it loaded — and
    // it still broke the suite, in a way no targeted run could show:
    //
    //     Cannot find module '/node_modules/drizzle-orm/d1/index.js&v=b448f4c1'
    //
    // Optimizing ANY entry point of a package version-stamps how the whole
    // package resolves. `drizzle-orm/d1` is `vi.mock`ed by 361 specs and was
    // deliberately kept OUT of `include` for exactly that reason — but out of
    // `include` is not out of reach. Adding it to `exclude` does not help
    // either; the `&v=` query is still attached and the mock's resolution
    // fails. Two calendar specs stopped collecting entirely.
    //
    // So the bar for adding an entry here is higher than "never mocked" and
    // "duplicate-safe" (the two criteria that let `drizzle-orm` through):
    // NO SUBPATH of the package may be mocked or aliased anywhere, and the only
    // way to know is a full `npm run test:unit`. A 31-file sample said yes and
    // was wrong.
    //
    // For the record, the two criteria that still apply on top of that:
    //   - Never mocked, package-wide. `vi.mock('drizzle-orm/d1')` × 361.
    //   - Duplicate-safe. A pre-bundled entry is a SECOND copy of that code.
    //     drizzle would have survived that by design — brands are
    //     `Symbol.for('drizzle:*')` from the global registry and `is()` compares
    //     `entityKind` STRINGS — but `@hono/zod-openapi` would not: it inlines
    //     its own `zod`/`hono` while server code imports both raw, so
    //     `extendZodWithOpenApi` would patch a prototype half the schemas never
    //     see.
    //
    // `exclude` keeps the stubbed Workers packages out: they are aliased above
    // to local stubs, and pre-bundling would resolve the real ones.
    //
    // To verify a change here, look for the artifact, never at the clock. Runs
    // of this suite vary by ±70% on an otherwise busy machine, which is more
    // than any plausible saving. Artifacts land in
    // node_modules/.vite/vitest/<sha1(project label, "" here)>/deps_ssr/ — and
    // "the file appeared" only proves it was BUILT. Prepend `throw new Error()`
    // to it and re-run: the specs must fail.
    //
    // ⚠️ And then run the FULL suite anyway. The poison test answers "is this
    // bundle loaded", which is necessary and, as the revert above shows, not
    // sufficient — it says nothing about what the package's other subpaths now
    // resolve to.
