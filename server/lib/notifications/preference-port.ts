 * heard of, so an unclassified or newly-added notification is never withheld.
 * The screen's promise and the send path's behaviour therefore cannot diverge.
 *
 * An address is resolved to BOTH id spaces (`users` and `contacts`) because one
 * person can be both — an agent with an account who is also a contact on an
 * inspection. A mute in either space counts: they are the same human, and
 * asking them to switch something off twice would be the kind of half-working
 * control that is worse than none.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN, like the suppression gate beside it: a lookup error means the mail
 * goes out. Silently dropping notifications because a query failed is the worse
 * of the two failures by a wide margin — the recipient never learns the message
 * existed.

 * copies of this resolution would be two answers to "whose row is this", and
 * the day they disagreed the symptom would be a person who unsubscribed and
 * kept receiving mail — which nobody reports, because the only evidence is an
 * email that did arrive.
 *
 * BOTH id spaces, because one person can be both: an agent with an account who
