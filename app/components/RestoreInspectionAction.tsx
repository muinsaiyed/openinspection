/**
 * Bring a mis-cancelled inspection back (#81).
 *
 * ONE COMPONENT, TWO SURFACES, because it is one decision. Recovery used to
 * exist only on the `/inspections` list row's status dropdown, while people
 * cancel from the inspection hub's Lifecycle card — so the surface that took
 * the mis-click was the one surface with no way out of it. Rendering the same
 * component in both places is what keeps the confirmation, the wording and the
 * write path from drifting into two half-answers.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS NOT AN UNDO, AND THE CONFIRMATION SAYS SO. The inspection returns to
 * `scheduled` and the recorded cancellation reason is cleared. The fee that was
 * kept and the refund that was issued already happened — they are ledger
 * entries, reversed by an invoice adjustment and by nothing on this screen.
 * Copy that promised a clean undo would be the more comfortable sentence and
 * the false one, so both halves are stated together, always.
 *
 * `tone="danger"` is deliberately NOT used on the dialog: restoring destroys
 * nothing, and dressing it in the delete dialog's red would push people away
 * from the correction they came here to make.
