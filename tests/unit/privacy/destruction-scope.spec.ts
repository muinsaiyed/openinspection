/**
 * `completed` and `certifiable` are two questions, and this file exists to keep
 * them apart.
 *
 * A record written before Durable Objects were purgeable says `completed`
 * truthfully: that purge finished everything it set out to do. It cannot
 * support a certification whose scope includes those objects, because it never
 * measured them. That is not a failed destruction — it is a narrower one, and
 * the difference has to be visible rather than inferred.
