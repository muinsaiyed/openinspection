/**
 * The invariant, proven against a REAL D1 binding.
 *
 * An account and its acceptance are one write. An outbox does not satisfy that,
 * because while the event sits unconsumed the state is
 * `account = EXISTS, acceptance_ledger = ABSENT`. So
 * the implementation puts both in one `db.batch()` and the invariant reduces to
 * a single claim about D1: A FAILED STATEMENT IN A BATCH UNDOES THE ONES BEFORE
 * IT.
 *
 * That claim cannot be tested in `tests/unit/`. The node suite runs
 * better-sqlite3, where `batch()` either does not exist or is a fixture we
 * wrote ourselves (`tests/unit/helpers/d1-binding.ts`) — and a test whose
 * subject is D1's transaction semantics, asserted against our own emulation of
 * them, proves only that our emulation agrees with itself. This spec runs in
 * workerd against the binding, so the answer comes from the thing being relied
 * on.
 *
 * The probe is a duplicate `(user, doc, version)`, which the schema's unique
 * index refuses. That is deliberately a LATE statement: the `users` insert has
 * already executed by the time it fails, so a non-atomic batch would leave an
 * account behind and this spec would see it.
