   * `/repair-builder/{tenant}/{id}` is a real route with create, add-item,
   * intro, share, PDF and email behind it, and `ReportHeader` already links
   * there. This panel is presentational — it holds a client-side selection and
   * no inspection identity — so the honest fix is to take the reader to the
   * flow, not to grow a second one here.
   *
   * NULL when the tenant has `enableCustomerRepairExport` off. The panel's own
   * toggle is gated only on `hideClientActions`, while the header's builder
   * link is gated on BOTH — so a tenant who switched the builder off can still
   * open this panel, and a Send that ignored the flag would hand back the
   * capability they turned off.
