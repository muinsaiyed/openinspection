/**
 * FIXTURE — the anti-vacuous pair for `probe-manifest-renamed.ts`.
 *
 * The array below is correctly named and complete. This doc comment quotes the
 * declaration anyway — `export const RETENTION_MANIFEST: RetentionRule[] = []`
 * — exactly as the renamed variant does.
 *
 * So the gate must exit 0 here. A parser "fixed" by refusing to parse any file
 * that mentions its own array name would pass the renamed test and fail this
 * one. The anchor is what tells the two apart: prose about a declaration is
 * indented, and a declaration is not.
