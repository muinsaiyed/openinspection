/**
 * An invited member's account and their acceptance are ONE write.
 *
 * `joinTeam` is the engine-native door: nobody else captured this acceptance, so
 * this side captures it, and the one-write invariant applies exactly as it does
 * on the portal-originated path. That is why it is a
 * `db.batch()` rather than an event — an outbox proves evidence was captured,
 * not that the ledger held it before the account existed.
 *
 * ── The basis is `individual_acknowledgement`, and that is the point ─────────
 * An invited member ACKNOWLEDGES; they do not bind the company. An invited
 * ADMIN also only acknowledges: being handed operational access is not being
 * handed the authority to sign. Without the basis column their row would be
 * indistinguishable from an owner's.
 *
 * ── Fail closed means the join is refused, not softened ─────────────────────
 * The documents come from the TENANT's own published Privacy and Terms. When
 * the tenant has published neither, there is nothing to record, and creating
 * the account anyway is precisely the state the invariant forbids. So the join
 * is refused — visibly, to the person trying to accept — rather than completed
 * with an empty ledger.
